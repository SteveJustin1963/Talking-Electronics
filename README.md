paraphrased account of video

"Mitchell and I founded a magazine called Talking Electronics with the aim of teaching electronics from the basics. To support our projects, we provided kits, which were an essential part of the magazine. Our business was a mail-order operation from my home, and we sold over 300,000 kits. My interest in electronics began when my aunt gave me her son's old radio equipment when I was 12 or 14. I tinkered with a crystal set, and when I added a little amplifier, I heard my own voice for the first time. From there, I produced lamp-loupe fires and began collecting old hearing aids from Myers, which led to my discovery of transistor-based hearing aids. I built my own amplifiers and began learning electronics on my own, even taking a course on electrical engineering when it became available.

"I wanted to learn about transistors, so I went to RMIT to learn the basics of electronics. However, the course only covered the theoretical structure of transistors with no practical application. At the time, the only transistorized device in my household was a six-transistor radio. I later spent 15 years in TV servicing during the early days of electronics, where there was a high demand for servicing despite cheaper radios becoming available. I sold and fixed hundreds of color TVs, including brands such as Philips, Luxor, Finlux, Normandy, Blaupunkt, Siemens, and Gratz. However, these TVs had badly manufactured Philips transistors, which gave a lot of trouble. When Japanese sets with better transistors arrived, I realized my business was disappearing as the sets were becoming more reliable. That's when I decided to start something new and came up with the concept of Talking Electronics.

"When I was 20, I wrote a magazine with a simple project using a few gates to control something. I had to describe each component of the circuit and how it worked so that service people could repair it if it failed. However, I didn't understand how a capacitor discharged to create oscillations and a cycle. I read through several books on integrated circuits and circuit design, but they only casually mentioned how circuits worked without providing in-depth explanations. As a result, I had to use my multimeter to describe how the circuit worked, and I realized that there was a void in circuit design knowledge. Servicing electronics required an understanding of the voltages on capacitors and why they failed or malfunctioned, which the books did not provide.

"Of course, they are expensive if you are the person doing it full-time. Well, I didn't know if it was going to be successful, I had no idea. So the only option I had was to write everything myself and get a typewriter. I could type anything out and get it typeset by someone who wasn't a typist. For the first magazine, I just used a typewriter and didn't spend any money on it. I bought a golf ball machine and typed everything out myself. I even did the layout myself, using cow gum to stick everything down. Even the circuit diagrams were drawn by hand with Indian ink. I brought out the first issue, which was a huge success, but I was so busy that I didn't have time to write the second one for about three months. When things slowed down a bit, I finally had time to write the next issue. It was an enormous amount of work to produce just one magazine. I didn't teach anything other than a very narrow field related to making an LED flash, so it was a very specialized area. This was in 1981, just as computers were starting to come in, but it was still a few years before computers could be used to teach or build anything. The only digital device available was called an orbit from Philips, and it consisted of a few transistors and resistors inside an enamel casing. Then we got the very first digital chips, CD 4011 and 4040."

"The Shepherd magazine published an article about FM bugs with a printed circuit board on the front, which became very popular. They sold 30,000 FM bugs, including voice-operated and telephone line bugs. The police even bought some to replace their noisy ones. However, the government was furious and raided Shepherd's place, resulting in court cases and financial loss. The court changed the law to enable the sale of the device, but criminal charges were still present for telephone line interception. Shepherd sent out 2,300 magazines to schools, but only received 19 replies, leading to a significant loss. Shepherd designed all circuits and projects himself, including games and trinket-like things that people wanted to build cheaply. The projects were successful and taught people how to put things together.


## The Victorian police
"Conversations with Colin Mitchell of “Talking Electronics” magazine fame. This interview took place on the 23rd of Feb 2011 in Melbourne. In the interview, Colin talks about his beginnings with electronics, how he got the idea for the magazine and the books that followed. Colin reveals how he was the first to put a printed circuit board on the front of the magazine and in a famous case, on the front of his series of books entitled “FM Bugs”. The Victorian police bought kits from Colin’s store, including one which could listen in to telephone conversations. This caused a lot of problems for Colin, which landed him a seat in the courts. The Australian WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ACT 1905 was "repealed" by Act No. 136 of 1983 thanks to Colin's case. Colin off course was shocked and dismayed but continued on selling other kits including the famous TEC-1 computer - A Z80 based project with detailed explanations on how to build and program it."

"I'll leave others to discuss the specifics of the demise of TE. 
From my point of view it stopped because the 1980s ended. Most of the electronics magazines consolidated and then folded by the 1990s. There was a new wave of computer and gaming magazines by then but the electronics magazines which were created to service a market of radio & hifi enthusiasts and TV service repairmen began to fade as a demographic. Electronics Australia, Electronics Today "International", two giants that always dwarfed TE (and resented it greatly) folded. TE's readership tended to split into hardware types and software types and moved into their own circles. "Electronics" was no longer the great binding topic, there were by then too many specialisations. Australian manufacturing (like the British) fizzled out as well as things became more uniform and standardised around IBM's PC (hell even Commodore and Atari vanished).
Then the web happened and also the open source software revolution which cut out the ability to sell information. From my point of view 1980s was a transitionary period from when information was still scarce and hard to obtain. By the mid-1990s, the great information firehose of the internet was everwhere and people are no longer starved of information but drowning in it.
Thankfully however, the internet also saved this stuff from complete obscurity and has given it some renewed exposure. Things that I thought had been lost forever, were scattered or locked away in private collections are now being shared and new things are being built. In the case of the TEC-1, I doubt we would be talking much about it today if it wasn't for the work of Ben Grimmett who got a new TEC-1 board out there and being made. Also thanks to the preservation work of Alan Laughton who collected together so much endangered software from that period. 
And this group of course which has the combination of nostalgic early readers of TE who remember when it was great combined with the next generation of creators and makers who bring a completely new angle to all of this."
