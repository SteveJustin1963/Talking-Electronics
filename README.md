## Talking-Electronics

Colin  Mitchell and I started a magazine called talking electronics the main point in inlet name starting the magazine was to help people actually learn electronics from the very basic levels and that's the reason why we produced a magazine and provided kits. this was the essential part of the magazine, is to provide a kit for every project we produced, we had a kid to back it up, everything operated from my home and it was a mail-order business basically and people could come if they wanted to buy the kits but most of it was done through the phone and through mail order. we sold over 300,000 kits. when I was about 12 or 14 my aunties son was interested in radio electronics and he was going to I think leave home for some reason and she gave me all his radio stuff which was old vacuum valves and an old radio things, but that was the first time I'd ever handled any electronic components myself. it was given to me then I was building a crystal set and I had the crystal set on the window ledge and had a crystal earpiece in it and I was tinkling around with another crystal earpiece somewhere near the front of the circuit and all of a sudden I heard my own voice and I thought how can that be I could hear my own voice. what I'd produced was a time little amplifier and of course that
changed my whole life because before I was just listening to radio stations and once I've got this an amplifier working it changed my whole idea of electronics that I could build something with which wasn't just her crystal set and nobody taught me anything and there was no books around I had a book on crystal sets and things like that but you just learn yourself. you use all the equipment you can get in those days with basically a multimeter and a very simple CRO but you just learn learn and learn and when a thing works or if it doesn't work, how you can fix it is the most important thing. so what I did is I then produced the lamp low fires and I was listening using his amplifier so listen around the room and I went to Myers & Myers had a hearing aid section and I asked them for any old hearing aids well they had a huge box of hearing aids there all with this tiny little pencil valves in them with five little tiny wires out of them and they had they worked on a 22 and a half volt battery and a 40 and someone had a 45 volt
battery and a one and a half fault but back to you for the filament so I got all these mountains of hearing aids and I went through them the vowel ones didn't interest me but down the bottom of this huge number they gave me with some hearing aids that had transistors in them and in those days they were the OSI transistors but a miniature version for hearing aids and they were plug in
they plugged into the board with a tiny little socket so now I had a three transistor and a five transistor hearing aid that worked off a couple of little tiny little batteries and that's where my electronics started by getting this hearing aids for free from from Meyers hearing aid service and I made mine maybe it'll amplifiers so then they turned around said well we've got a new course coming out which electrical with electronics so I said well that's for me because I want to learn electronics I want to learn about these things there's new things called these transistors so I went to RMIT and I learned about the basics of electronics. well it was very very the minimum out you could possibly imagine we had practical work once a week and it was to do with the theoretical structure of a transistor. there was nothing really associating the the transistor device with anything was available and I had
bought a six transistor radio a I thought it was a national or Hassani or send asani it could have been a sunny sunny six transistor radio but apart from that that was the only thing that we had in the households electronics which was transistorized in
those days. then I did 15 years of TV service I think in in the early days of electronics there was a demand for for servicing even though that the radios were a lot cheaper the ones from Hong Kong and Japan were better they gave a better quality they were really a better device and also the TVs I sold hundreds and hundreds of color TVs. we had the philips TV here the color TV. well I was absolutely flat out fixing the philips tv, the luxor TV, the Finlux TV, normandy Blaupunkt siemens gratz, all these TVs had badly philips transistors in them and they all gave an enormous amount of trouble. well when the Japanese sets came with the Japanese
type of transistor which had a higher voltage rating that immediately changed from two to three jobs per year to no jobs and of course I could see the business was dying and that's why I sat down and I said well look my business is absolutely disappearing because the sets become so reliable that I have to change into something else and that was the reason why I turned around and said well I think of something else and the concept of talking electronics came along. I had written a magazine when I
was about 20 years of age I was asked to
produce a project a very simple project
using a few gates and things like that
to control something I kinda knew what
it was now so I I made the device and he
wanted a few more made that he also
wanted a description of how the circuit
worked so that he could give it to the
service people so that the thing failed
they could they could service it so I
looked at
how the circuit worked and I had to
describe each component and there's a
couple of components that I didn't quite
understand as to how they charged and
there's a capacitor there and how it was
helped discharged I understood how it
charged through the resistor but how did
discharge to create the the oscillations
to create the cycle so I went to McGill
z-- and I bought about four hundred and
thirty dollars worth of books on
integrated circuits and designing
circuits and I read through them and
read through them and nowhere did they
actually describe they describe the
oscillator it's all written there but
they didn't describe how that capacitor
discharged so I turned around said well
I've got to actually find out because I
want to describe that part of it so I
had to get my multimeter out there to go
to all the work of describing how it
worked and I realized that there was a
slight void there on they just very
casually went over how circuits work but
didn't actually go into the epic because
when you ask a question or how does this
work there was never ever answered they
just said it oscillates well that's not
good enough when you're servicing
something because you want to know what
voltage is on these capacitors you want
to know why they're failing or why is it
why something going wrong so you need to
know the intimate reasons as to why
something is charging and discharging so
that was the reason why I thought well
there's a demand there this isn't a
niche market was an area there that the
magazines aren't providing for so I then
turned around and thought up the name
for a magazine because of the original
name for a magazine with Australian
experimenter I didn't want to use that
name and I just thought up the name
talking electronics you know it's a good
play on words so now I've got a concept
I've got an idea and I want to do
digital circuits and I've got the name
of the magazine so it all came together
and I sat down for about three months
and started writing articles for a
magazine saying the whole magazine I did
everything well you couldn't employ
people because they didn't even know how
to to do layouts for magazines in those
days
and of course they're expensive in if
you in the person full-time well I
didn't know it's gonna be terribly
successful I had no idea so the only
thing I could do was to write everything
myself and to get a typewriter and I
could you put anything on a typewriter
and and the type thing out I could get a
typeset by someone who wasn't type so it
was actually just typed out on a
electronic typewriter or electric
typewriter and for the first magazine it
was just on a typewriter no expense or
vertical expense to me I just bought a
golf ball machine and just typed it out
myself and laid everything out myself I
lived I got pages from the the printer
will lay out sheets and put everything
down with cow gum that horrible sticky
gooey stuff and laid everything out and
stuck everything down and even though
every single item was all stuck down in
little tiny pieces and everything was
ready for them to print I'm not a good
artist so some of the main some of the
magazines I had or books I had a cutout
some of the odd pictures of things so
that I couldn't copy myself and circuit
diagrams I just did it myself with a pen
and Indian ink and with electro set I
used to use a lot of electricity and but
even though electricity was a they
didn't have the symbols I wanted they
had the letters R and a major sign and a
few other things which I use initially
but they didn't have the the symbols I
wanted so I had to sort of draw all
those myself but it was all done by hand
I brought the first one out and it was
such a huge success that I was
absolutely flat out cuz I only had one I
employed somebody I deployed to buy
first an employer I had the magazine and
I was busy I couldn't I didn't have time
to write the second magazine for about
two or three months it was so busy every
day answering the phone for orders and
by mail I got more orders and of course
people started to come around to buy the
kits from from my own home so I had no
time at all
to even start to write the second maze I
had already articles there but I didn't
have any spare time to really sit down
and really set the magazine and set it
up for about two or three months when
things started to
slow down a bit I had a bit of free time
to write the next issue of the magazine
so I don't know how someone like Leo
Simpson can write a magazine every month
it's enormous amount of work Elektra is
absolutely enormous and it's getting
even bigger now but even in those days
to learn just one and that was my whole
field was just to teach a very narrow
area I didn't teach our if I didn't
teach communications it was just to do
with just making a LED flash something
very very simple it was about 1981 at
the time when computers had just barely
come in that computers to teach anything
or to actually build a computer it still
hadn't come in so it really was in the
days that the digital had just come in
transistors and the chip had just
arrived just before the magazine the
only digital device that was a little
available was called an orbit from
Philips and it consisted a couple of OC
44 OC 71 transistors and a few resistors
inside an enamel mininum casing and all
it did it had about 12 leads coming out
of it he had to figure out what lead did
what and it was purely an N gate or an
or gate or an or gate or something like
that and then straight after that we got
the the very first digital chips CD 401
1 404 double-o 1 and this was the
beginning of the digital era I produce a
number of issues and then I was playing
around with a tired little circle a
little transmitting circuit and I just
jumbled a few wires together and this
was the the final FM bug little tiny FM
bag so I went to the radio in the next
room turned it on and I could hear the
staff in the other room as clear as a
bell talking and I was absolutely amazed
that it transmitted about 20 meters
total radio and as clear as anything so
I thought that this is unbelievable so I
went back to the circuit and you know I
had
offer wire to the antenna so would I put
the wire back on to the antenna and went
back to the radio it was still just as
clear but I was able to get a little
effort a small FM radio and go not only
at the front door but down the street
about two or three houses and I thought
that was absolutely amazing to go about
hundred meters before it only went to
the to the radio and was a little bit
tiny little bit noisy but I actually
connected the antenna it was absolutely
magnificent it was as perfect as an FM
radio station it was my design that's
right I proved on our on a very poor
design that I picked up
so improved on the design and I produced
a one an Shepherd book from the magazine
called FM bugs and I thought what a good
idea to put a printed circuit board on
the front that would sort of promote
things well it just took off it just
absolutely snowboard because now people
couldn't even had the printed circuit
board for less than $10 they could buy
the whole kit and we sold 30,000 of
these FM bugs
it was absolutely enormous that's the
way it started with these printed
circuit boards on the front of the
magazine with the FM bugs there was just
so many variations we've produced a
voice operated one and of course then we
finished up putting some on the on the
telephone line very simple device went
on the phone line and of course because
actually we sold the FM bugs to the
police as well because the bugs that
they had were noisy and you couldn't
understand them and they were terrible
of course ours were very cheap and of
course you knew policemen was the way he
acted he came and bought the thing he
wouldn't see him again
but of course they our bugs were found
in the secure police station
and they bought one for the telephone
line and of course they were furious the
whole government was furious and of
course they saw the PC board knew where
came from and of course they raided us
not only did we get federal police we've
got tax inspectors
and local police coming around raiding
the whole place because of the these
interception devices and of course there
was court cases over it cost us a
fortune so it was a real real headache
it was only when it was attached to a
telephone line
it was interception of the telephone
line was there was a criminal charge and
of course I never put mine on but the
the wording of the court case was
changed to enabling somebody to
intercept a conversation I didn't have
to do it myself as long as I assisted
not even assisted somebody but with the
word was enable somebody and they've
changed the law to actually sell the
device not only made up but also in kit
form so any bag of parts at all can be
turned around because then he'd take any
number and I could build these bugs on
the phone line any way at all
with any any of my kids could do because
I had the same transistor the same
components and it yeah so any one of my
kids could have been a kid for in naming
someone to intercept a phone line well
if they caught me at the third time I
got a hundred and twenty years jail I
just stopped I just stopped producing it
that's all I sent out in issue five I
sent out two thousand three hundred of
talking at twice magazines to every
single school in Australia that was high
school technical school Catholic school
private school two thousand three
hundred for them to subscribe to the
magazine in the next year I got 19
replies at 2300 it was an enormous loss
I think it was I think that there was
very exciting for people to to be
actually to build something which used a
chip and and change from a fact that
just they used transistors before and
then we got the chips and it was a it
was a concept which was new check all
the circuit side
design everything that I designed I
designed myself they knew they would
novel there were games there were little
trinket II things but they were
successful people just wanted to learn
to put a few things together and it did
something it turned the lid on and made
a noise or it did something and that was
the whole idea is to is to build a very
cheap project under about ten or twelve
dollars booth my magazine my whole
concept was that every project I
produced was backed up by a kit and this
was the first time in the world that
anyone had done that and not only that
but I was the first in the world to put
a printed circuit board on the outside
of the magazine and the printed circuit
board had an overlay and it had solder
mask
and it had tin solder land so the board
when it was sold it came up perfect
other thing was this new world of
digital things where you push buttons
and made something flash so there was a
completely different market than anybody
else had tackled so that was when I
started that the talking electronics and
that was why I was so successful because
that's what other people want to do is
world they wanted to make these things
something they could take a lot to
school and show in other show and tell
us something and actually did something
they could show everybody else what
they'd produced as soon as the magazine
came out we've got an enormous number of
orders for simple magazine and we just
went on and on and on with with with the
more more projects along those same
lines we also introduced other projects
and as the other projects weren't
successful
we didn't go along the amplifier market
we didn't go along the radio market they
weren't nearly as successful as just
these projects that made made LEDs flash
and noises and tones and things will
leave the 74 series of chips they were
really associated with with computer
designing a computer and the actual
digital chips that we dealt with with
the CD type chips which were the purely
an engagement nor gate on all gate or an
XOR gate they were the chips used for
the simple digital
the our tech computer from 12 neckties
was a z80 based and it was a
z80 chip and it just used a very small
amount of raman ram and a very simple
set of six seven seven segment displays
and a very simple 20 key keep head with
hexadecimal keys on it just to explain
the very basics of how a computer works
and that was that we sold a lot like we
sold over 1200 of these computers and
then people built on themselves and they
worked it I didn't work they could send
in to repair we got very few sent in
they did work and out of that we got
quite a number of actual games that
people actually wrote for that
particular computer and we publish them
in issues of the magazine so that was
very successful we initially started in
issue 10 with the mate with the with the
computer and somebody said that the
maker that the magazine has only got
black and white and one color on the
front if you put full-color yoursel more
issues so I put full-color on issue
number 10 we sell no more issues so it
was a total waste of money spending the
extra hundreds of dollars another
thousand dollars on getting color
separations but we did put the tech
computer on the front in full color and
it sold very well right from the very
beginning we're making up hundreds of
time they were gone in no time back have
a batch of another hundred so it was a
starting point to teach people
programming in machine code using the
the z80 as the the basics of the whole
unit we had a speaker there he produce
tunes and tones one of the staff did he
came along one day and said he's I don't
know where he got it from that could
have been someone said it's a slight
copy from somewhere else but the fact in
he knew about computing he was very very
good and he made the first prototype for
us we didn't made a printed circuit
board then he was actually working for
me B just came as a
one of the one of the workers friends
then I said - oh well that's Butte now
can you sit down and write how it works
is that I haven't got time I've got to
do my schooling so I said well now I've
got this computer I've never used a
computer in my life I had to sit down
and design a few very simple games and a
few simple things on how to get from the
keyboard to get a simple program to run
on these displays so I had to learn z80
programming which wasn't hard there were
700 instructions but you knew basically
what different things did it still took
me two weeks to sit down and learn the
code to produce a simple program and
then of course once I got the programs
written I could actually copy them out
put them in the magazine explain to
people how it works and get them to get
the magazine out quite a number of
people already said that they got into
electronics via that tech computer and
they're still in electronics now I think
the heyday of the 1970s was the absolute
peak because you were able to buy all
the most advanced components integrated
circuits and then of course the chip
came in for computers and you could
build something yourself because it
wasn't available on the market and the
computer you did buy soon ran out of
memory so you can add certain things to
it and you can improve it because then
the Chinese saw that there was a demand
for added boards for computers faster
speed different graphics cards and of
course they turned around and produced
the thing perfected it made it beautiful
and sold through the Chinese shops here
through the Chinese importers and a
fraction of the cost that we to buy the
components for

hi I'm here with Colin Mitchell from talking electronics Fame everyone in
Australia will instantly recognize the name Colin Mitchell in these talking electronics magazine and if you want to
know I get asked all the time where I learned electronics and how I learn electronics well this man had a big hand
in it say thank you very much God good that love is talking electronics I learn a lot of electronics from the talking
electronics magazine and we're here Colin's going to take us through small stuff and we're going to talk about the
history of talking electronics
you now I just want to mention this is like this is particularly episode right now I
didn't particularly want to spend a lot of money on printing the magazine having all that expensive of writing the
magazine and actually laying it all out so I went to electronics Australia when
I what date was this 1985 1985 is the letter I've got and I just can't
remember just how advanced I was but the basic concept was that I went to them I
said look instead of me putting out this magazine being competition with you what
I suggest is that I want to put in say 24 pages in the middle of your magazine as a pullout section I didn't
particularly want to have advertising in it so that the people can understand just simple projects and maybe I could
back them up with a kit because there wasn't real there wasn't kits in those days as such I would dismiss doing kids
no not oh no he wasn't well no they're probably doing a few odd kits they had fun ways in fun ways but they didn't
really specialize in having the kid from electronics Australia in that month they
might have had to put in a circuit board because I went along to Ella Stronach s-- and I asked him that does he sell
electronics Australian kids he said I we don't have any kids from them but they do send us down printed circuit boards
each month and it's there they're available and the people can make up the kit by going around the store making the
making the making the kit I said well how many hundred kits do yourself from
each of the kids per month he said Cole hundreds he said we get twenty boards yeah well that's good a twenty boards
from each kid and and how many do you service it come and I'll show you so we went upstairs in the shop upstairs in
the shop and in a great big try a big trade this high the size of a table with
hundreds of printed circuit boards on all in plastic bags and he said they're
the board's I said how many said maybe one or two so I look at them they had no
overlay on them no legend no
tinning they were Jody no Disney I'll just be a copper Wow but the worst part
was is that they had no numbers or names on except ei for 176 strokes 302 497 for
who knows not a name on it not even the name of the kid yeah just a number well how on
earth could you work that out that's crazy that's madness so I realized I learned
my lesson never do that so I was the first person even in those days to put a legend on
all the boards to tin them and also to put solder mask on them all solder mask
was Wow that was fine no one did it it was all available yeah no the boards did it they'll just bare copper so anyway
that jag ahead of the point before all that I went along to electronics Australia and I'd send them a letter to
say that I didn't particularly want to spend all the money on a magazine what about 20 and 24 pages are pull oxygen
and I got a letter back these are the reign of Jim row yes yes yes Jim Jim row
has sent me a letter back um just sort of saying that all you know that all the
costs involved in putting in these 24 pages and things like that and not terribly happy about it but if you want
to go ahead with it look we'll consider it he said but on the second page you said a bit dumb and just in case you
don't turn up with the goods the 24 pages there will be a figure of a $7,500
fine mine now $7,500 in those oh my car
cost me $3,500 no it was two cars in
other words he didn't want you to do it that was I wasn't prepared so yeah so three or four years later he saw me he
came down saw me he said oh you probably didn't like what I wrote in the lid I said I certainly didn't admit I never
replied I didn't like her the embarrassment replying or saying anything at the shock of $7,500 fine was
astronomical ah that's amazing oh yes because the magazine only cost less than five thousand dollars for ten
thousand copiers about forty fifty cents a copy so if you imagine seven thousand dollar fine was a huge amount in those
days so that's the main thing I'm just saying this that you know there's always more than one way of doing business
always more than one way if something goes wrong I always say will you've learned a lesson
yeah there's a there's a reason for that and the reason was I started my magazine
and it succeeded it was a huge success I sold hundreds of thousands of kids the
one of the biggest kit makers and until the others claiming they saw how many kits I was making and then well Jake a
start up again a Joe Gary Nelson Boylston walk bought J car and he did the kits and of course then we've got Al
Tronics he started making the kits and of course they did they made it a choice Australian kits and e TI kits and they
were quite successful so I had did have competition but I knew that I had my own
kits and there were totally different kits are a very simple kit but we did so many minute I think it was about thirty
thousand FM bug just of the choir just of the just a just that yeah because we put the board on the magazine yeah it
was a very cheap board and I didn't particularly like it but the manufacture had very thin paper bakelite board then
he said look I'll do the board for five cents for you and my wife's and five cent chairs Wow I always wondered what was the
motivation for putting the PCB on the front five cent before because it was
just cost you're so cheap adhere you can that's right yes it right well the expensive part was sitting down and
actually sticky taping them on that you know you can only do a few hundred an hour and I was there every night doing a
couple hundred now I had people coming around five dollars an hour just as hours and hours of work or twenty
thousand magazine to put them on and then of course we had PC boards that
were stapled on yes I remember and I won and I designed the stapling machine to push the pedal because you need
enormous amount of pressure push those staples it test tape at the time yeah and have a very big leverage on the actual
mechanism a lose leverage see custom-built they're just for one it one
we had two machines we had two machine and you could read you get for each magazine no no no until idiot hold
that's like the holes always in the same place so the magazine always fitted in the spot yeah bored went on and the two
staples went down at the same time we had to - they used old television cabinets right to mount the staplers on
I had to staplers on it on each machine and we had to have two machines because he had to did twenty thousand and took
weeks and weeks to do it but it doesn't a little bit of an engineering that I designed those stapling machines to to
staple those staples on and they were 50 Cent's aboard because they were glass
tie fiberglass right there was and no good quality and they had they had over
layered it's like they didn't have solder must know that if the nest solder mask but they had Tino attend right so
at in yeah but not sold a masked and they had an overlay on yeah and now 50 cents a board if it were twenty thousand
fifty cents and who made the boys well I had three different people making them one was better than the other and I had
different manufacturers all beating each other in the price but the local man he really boo because it was cash and it
was a twenty thousand dollar or 20,000 aboard production line and you can just
imagine in those that they had quad drills and they could only drill I think three or four deep and four of them four
so they had boards Austin multi-model eight of eight boards on a panel but there are quad drills and you can
imagine hundreds of holes in each one and just doing the same board for twenty thousand there's weeks of work but they
did it they did it and we got through with no a huge success and a star the people of course the
boards from overseas again the English magazine had them no overlay on them no
tinning just pure copper no identification on them at all it was just I've still got the board because it
wasn't a pleasure making them it was just really the board's they weren't very good project anyway but it just
wasn't worthwhile making the things because it just didn't finish up all our boys finish up beautiful all finish up
the best you could do in those two so it was a huge advancement we did we did actually start a few original ideas
the pender circuit models one and the other thing was to have no list or no advertising in it yes I know your words
very and you'd like to talk about that in the magazine - you like - that's how I read as a bit I remember you giving
the story yes because what happened is that I did a little bit of work with one of the magazine people and what I
particularly didn't like was that the first thing they did they laid all the
sheets out all all the pages are all laid out on a huge table and the first thing that came along with the
advertising people put all their layout all on the magazine right and he turned around to me and a couple now fill the
holes and I thought that's what they treat you like right all the editorial
all the most important material is just fill now fill the holes now that was their attitude and then I said I will
never ever present that attitude to people look I'm just writing on the back of your head yeah so that's the reason
why I wrote no a very little advertising because I didn't like your thumbing
through electronics Australian in those magazines and in fact what I've done is I've taken the hundreds of em magazines
I had which were filled up all these shelves here yeah I took out all the articles and the article rate is high
all the ratio I put in the bin yeah now I've sorted them out all into into articles and of all those probably four
meters high finished up that much worth of articles fantastic so how did you
produce the magazine back in those days there was no computer so it was all just literally you would on a typewriter on a
time here live a little call an electronic typewriter it had a memory in it um and it was all hand done all stuck
down every little tiny thing was all liturgy without glue a horrible cow gum
oh but of course the cow gum makes all the paper brown right yeah and so all
the artwork I've got now is absolutely well that's ruined it's all browsers Brown as a berry
now and even though the pieces are all stuck down some of those circuit diagram
would have had over a hundred little stick downs because everything had to be stuck down all d'être setter yep because
letras it was very expensive so we finished up typing out those that all left different symbols and just sticking
them down as separate items but that's all we have and that's why you hand drew a lot of a your hand wrote a lot of you
like your ten minute digital that was another concept on that grid idea there was another concept I had seen that
somewhere else and the other persons there are you copied message well I was I copied you because it was a that was thing um the man from for America Oh
Forrest me yes that's not the competent engineers near he's awful that's right yes right so that I had the we hardly at
regional other his was original but I got a hundred sheets printed yeah with a very gray back or a stipple and with a
blackboard around I got a hundred sheets printed and of course when you write on your can't afford to make a mistake because any any whiteout you showing so
be very careful to write to the page with a lot of work did you draft them further no I don't know I just sat down
this is carefully thought that right and worked it out to the page yeah and it
takes a lot of time because you had to do it all by hand with with it was a very fine tip black Tim pending I
wouldn't make a mistake in there to think about it but it was very successful it was another concept of teaching someone because some people are visual
some people want to see diagrams of drawings and of course now that we've got videos it that's going to teach a
lot more people because a lot of electronics people may not be able to work out the square root of -4 but they
can certainly make a project absolute and they can solder and they going to think yeah so that there are this people
have a certain ability so you're going to cotton on to that ability and and say
look once you learn electronics you're made you are absolutely made because you
can go into servicing design you can go into so many areas and you don't have to
be a brilliant engineer don't have to even be able to know the English language backwards as
but electric is a different field well it's a practical field as long as you can build something and badly rescue
something we can't put our finger on here because some of the cleverest people that are that I've had at just
the average person that has come along but absolutely brilliant electronics yeah but only did very average in school
yeah so they're the people that we're trying to encourage it and with videos and all these different areas and
sometimes these people click and as I hate that's for me and the young you get
it's wonderful but whatever the age is if you can just click on electronics you
can make it and become successful and that's what we're all here for that's why we've got all these different areas
and videos and the internet and all these different areas that people can
just pick up on electronics do you have any idea of what your demographics were
back in the heyday what what age groups people want was it mainly young people it was mainly yes that's right yeah
because all the magazine in the newsagent because this is before the before the internet kitties yes right we
didn't know you see when it was agent my idea is to get the person very very
young and bring them up to their level that's the level that's never covered by any institutions never covered by the
universities or any of the technical schools they all want you to to know something or they teach you far too much
mathematics and then it slows you down anything all this mad you don't need it
if you want to do in something put the resistors in put them in parallel measure it and you find that you'd spend
ten minutes working out the value and only a fraction of a second to measure on a meter I learn if business is in
power well calculate while and triple calculus and Maxwell's equations and everything he does you know okay it's
wonderful to be able to have that ability but I'm just saying you can get through without it yep you can get
through with just using test equipment and you do amazing things with the simplest of test equipment absolutely so
you don't need expensive things you can do with experimentation and developing things so that was my
area to - teach people just to bring them up without expensive equipment and
complicated circuit diagrams just to teach them the basics and it was a huge success because we saw where we were one
of the biggest kit suppliers hundreds of thousands of kids that's right very successful how many how many copies of
each issue well there did you produce and well what happened is that we reprinted 20,000 you see what happened
is that I went to electronics Australia and I said well how many copies to
yourself and they said I really ship is 72,000 so I thought oh well that's
72,000 I'll just print 20 or 25,000 and see how it goes so we sold out of the
25,000 we sold about 14,000 yeah and I thought that was fair enough because I'm
only dealing with a very small absolute very small in the area paper not no amateurs no none of the people in audio
there's a whole lot of areas that we didn't cover didn't have a high technicians things like that then I was
had a few magazines out and then I found the truth with electronics Australia when they say 72,000 with their
readership they multiply the sold copies by 2.3 why 2.3 was just the way the
magic number that's right so that when they were trying to sell advertising they said our readership of 72,000 so
divided 72,000 by 2.3 so it's less than half so that's thirty five thirty
thousand your way so you won't be surprised to know I've learnt the same thing once I've got into this business
and or advertising everything else nice it's still going on yeah in the eyes
main section it is that's right yep so that's the reason why I only tell the truth yeah absolutely pointless a
readership is at point disfigure how many sold copies I saw about 14,000 right so what happened is that the other
um six or eight thousand that weren't sold I've got about three or four
thousand back I had to pay or the five cents a copy but they said
they said the other ones were lost I know they were sold and I didn't get it right so that was why the news ages make
a fortune because they don't normally get 25 percent they get a hundred percent when they say that they leave
they haven't sold if I don't mean stolen have you ever seen a newsagent go under they don't because they're living off
all the magazine's so I've got back about 60 or 70 thousand by the time I've
done a lot of magazines and a lot of other ones so what I decided to do I say decide to put them into packs of two and
three now I remember that yes yes old off and we sold them again yes to this to the people for a few dollars for
three magazines so that every single magazine was so we didn't waste any yep so the whole we printed out 20,000
multiplied by about 25 different issues and some of them were reprinted again so
overall I think there was about between 500 to 700 thousand copies or actually
sold because even the ones that were stolen from the shop they were still sold copy somebody got them in the
finish because the newsagent just couldn't account for them so that was a
huge success there where did you find that your readership increased with know
it very much no no yes that's right do you change yes it didn't taste okay some
but after about the direful 10th issue somebody has said it at all put color on the cover so on the 10th issue for the
that's right you change to cut X I put the four for color color yeah for Cal how much cotton excellent two or three
thousand dollars more I had to get separations yeah and was a four color machine instead of a two color machine
so it cost quite a few thousand dollars more do you know it didn't increase the sales we do it yes we ain't heard it for
one or two times and then we back went back to two color right didn't change I just wanted to prove to people that
letters people knowledge in color no content that shows either con so that the wonderful thing we get now from
silicon chip that is the top magazine in the world yep the color the quality of
the paper the articles in fact EPA the English magazine is just stealing the content
holes bowls oh there there's a licensing agreement between the two that's right yeah just
maybe they don't read moles wish it's it's all jim's row and it's all ten-year-old stuff that's all going in
there directly directly inserted and it's improved their magazine you considerably exactly but um England did
have a very good magazine NAPLAN magazine that's right err color that couldn't keep it up because it was too
expensive the overheads were too much right how many how many magazines were they
were there in Australia back in the p55 there was elector and lecture that that
was an Australian though yes it was was it yes they didn't get hands men's hands
hands Mouse man's hands he brought it here right hens man's or hands prodigy
all right for four or five issue okay he got the license and he pleaded a slighted every member seen in my news
agency first few months right and there was et i yes then there was electronics
Australia yeah then there was hobby projects Oh was that a separate one that
was the competition to me what happened is that when I bought my magazine out it
was only just start to come out hmm I don't know whether they got the first issue out or not but um II Latasha
Australia found out about it and it was Colin rivers found out I got the
magazine and he sent all his men around to all the electronics shops to sell
them half price advertising for 12 months I know so that when I sent my man
around I sent bill around be he got to the third shopping in the city there and he rang me up and said Electronics
Australia ETI International is been around and has sold them all advertising
for tall mutts at half price and they've got no money left over for anything else I said don't worry bill come back and
I'll cut the advertiser I want to put any advertising at all and we'll continue on with no over at all so that's that's what happened
there right then what they did is they brought their magazine hobby electronics in with Lil wait and various other
holloway oh yes sir and mine was $1 $25 $20 25 they brought theirs in four
ninety five cents then they started with 30,000 then they brought in there and whatnot 40,000 Wow then they flooded it
with 50,000 then after six months : rivers rang me up and I remember I was sitting in the room the phone rings at :
rivers here and he said you've won the day and I said what do you mean he said I well we're pulled out yep
with the magazine it cost us forty or fifty thousand dollars and they'll
running at a loss were they or officially they were had very appetizing in it but they wanted not me because
they just do what the competition says made no difference to me I still sell my ten to fourteen thousand
it made no difference to me because I knew that it was competition and they wasn't locked it because there's only
Det I in a choice Australia was there Australian electronics monthly back then
yes daddy death was taken off that was okay another one that was taken from the
men who has some as well electronics he call yes he had some he did writing for
the magazine and that was a take off because one other he left somewhere else and he started showing electronics
monthly from ETI or Roger Herod no Roger
Harrison I suppose it was against Sonny right anyway he had a son he wrote a few articles will so that date in silicon
chip of course lefty Legation 87 wasn't ID I don't remember side a nice year they
started see that's right and that was all full color you know there's been a huge success yeah and of course that that was the one
that really killed electron sauce tralier and killed atra yeah and killed
a phone electronics monthly whatever changes name well federal publishing killed it they tried to turn it into a
glossy consumer magazine I do they are all the customers oh yes that's right yes it originally and it
and they cut out all the technical art and their hobby things all holy stuff is gone and it's just that started the CD
player reuses right also stuff and it lasted about five issues or something and then it just died no silicon chip is
it's brilliant um absolutely it's half quality for a tiny country like Australia
I know it's they're very successful those notebooks are very successful the engineers and electronics notebooks
starting with TTL everything right and these are all um these are all hand
these some of the pages were hand does summary pages were hand-drawn yeah there we go all hand-drawn stuff fantastic uh
and then you just photo reduce these okay I used to method used to fifty percent was too much Ryan you can only
reduce something to 70 percent yep it's still readable it wasn't readable
night-air yes that's right and I produced magazines like this anymore it's all computer desktop publishing
when did the desktop publishing thing starting oh well my first one was a I
was about three or four thousand dollars of electronic typewriter yeah and it was
called just will justify so that you type it yeah and then you push the
button that you were justified with just like column yet was parallel columns and it had a huge memory in the back there
to remember all this because of you for the cuz in those days yeah if the cards are only a few K yeah yeah hey
that's couple of pages right let's all a while well indeed of quite a few K just to give you some a high age okay right
so had all his memory in the back had pay thousands of extra for memory yeah and I bought a 300 dpi and laser printer
henan laser printer which was thousands of dollars and I bought Adobe font on it
which was not a twelve hundred dollars just for the font card for the font that we've been into into the machine so the
whole thing was very expensive I think my first computer was about twelve or fourteen thousand dollars Wow
for the computer the hard drive was a tower the keyboard and quite a few
thousand dollars for the three thousand three hundred dpi printer yep now 300
enough yeah then I bought for a quarter the price I bought a 600 dpi and it was
quite readable quite readable it much much better so from then I produced the
magazines on 600 dpi yeah and that the last magazines are also any can't tell the difference between photo typeset and
600 dpi talking electronics when how
many people did you have working for you it as the pker that work once at 8:00 8:00 and you were still working from
home yes 35 well maybe I built on the back are you post on the back years no bilqis aside built on the back I never
ate people working on sir well yeah yes because I had two people in one room two
people another room to another room and two people in the lounge room hi and I had okay so the house was fully occupied
as it workspace yes right yes Oh quite a few rooms in the house yeah I built on
that it's a little separate area at the back there I built one and only different rooms yeah excellent
how how long did that last that sort of the peak peak it was only be it two years only a couple of years okay it
seems to seems to me to be much longer than that from my memory no there was a peak as you said the pit yep it built
back and up and up to it I did two years of peak and then just faded away again but it was always a mail-order business
from home wasn't that well I did I had three inputs I have people coming um now
what happened is that I applied one boy who stole some things right so that we
dismissed him on the spot of course his father was furious rang up the local council yeah
and of course claimed that I mean I'm working for premises at the back of the house right is illegal I said well is it
illegal they said I use it's illegal to run a shop at the back I said well what's a definite definition of a shop it's our
word you've got things on display I said no that's not a definite different definition of a shop the definition of a
shop is a sort of a cash register all right I see I don't have a cash register
there you go so it's not a shot so that was the legal definition is right that's how you got around yes because you can
have things sitting out there because when assembly place yeah and he said
well your week in the second thing you said oh well I see you've got advertisements here and you're promoting
your address in there virtus ones I said well that's by law I said when you have a mail-order business you must have the
address as well that's part of the law so that doesn't hold water either I so
you so that yep he tried to close me down right I said well you can't close me down
first of all I've been here eight years yep secondly the neighbors haven't
complained thirdly it's not a shop yep it is purely we are assembling things
here and we are designing things for the magazine which is which is not no
features our shop yeah the fact that people come here is because they want to
come and buy the stock yeah by an ID which we can't refuse them if they come here we don't have we don't say that
there's a refusal you can touch on because by law you have to allow people to come because otherwise you classify
subversive industry right you don't allow people to see what you're doing massive industry so it's yes that's
right so that's how you get around it hahaha so is that because there are some very nasty people yeah so that was one
thing then they try to bring around health inspector with with health and
things like that and came in and do you have a first-aid kit SN what are you the
first aid kit for all what are you doing here I said well one is sold or something might burn themselves and soldering I said fellas come in here now
there's fire you're sold now you'll been here how many years how many time you burnt yourself look so you know they've
been here 20 years all up ya know it's burnt themselves so far so why do you
need likelihoods a lot that's right so that you know I said no Technic you have to have two toilets while you two talk
all because it might be a female work well there aren't in you know females here yeah so you've got one toilet here
and one Talde in the house so we do have tutorials so he tried everything it closes down
health and inspection of things like that so we got away with it from them so
as I say that you do find some nasty people trying to close you down trying all these tricks in the book and I said
that isn't it funny that going back those years I said isn't it funny how the government is trying to promote
cottage industry yeah because they wanted to stop people from driving all the way to worse
unnecessarily yep you're trying to promote cottage industry and even some what does have community is trying to
close them down I know it's yeah it's ridiculous is maddening how do you think
things would have changed if Jim Rowe had accepted that thing and you went into who knows right oh yeah yeah yeah
you probably wouldn't have been a success you would you would have I don't know maybe well you might have probably
still would assault sold the kid yes I could have done year things would have changed there but the thing is that it
just did die away the whole every year you could just see dying away and going away oh it's a shame cuz the Chinese
just came on and on and him and just improved everything just improved any other stories hardly ever got enough
tape we're gonna know well a young boy came to me and he was in grade six
another brilliant person but you didn't know at the time cool came to me bought a kid your bed I'm sad then morning with
his father yeah pulled up bought a kit came back and bought another kid came back bought
another kid and I lost track and they came back he wanted I think it was a tech computer I said you can't buy it he
said why not I said because you got to make at least eight projects yes I had
I've made eight projects brilliant yeah anyway and he built the
computer yeah and now that I've seen him again it has another brilliant person
but he was in grade six yep when okay that's fantastic see I had nothing back I had nobody who
was in computer not my parents well they supported me by you know letting me do
it but they didn't know anything about it was unavailable it was only the candy stores I know he gets all rubbish
that's all I had all I had was the magazines I could get from my local newsagent that I could ride my bike to I
remember riding my bike to the newsagent cassette you didn't have a regular schedule now and also I Drive my bike
there a couple of times a week and go to the newsagent ah is there a new talking electronics magazine or is there in you
that's a great advance but the whole thing well them just by me the fact that the very first day I sent it to Gordon and
GOC they send it out on Friday and it all went to the stores on on a Friday
and on the Monday I've got 80 orders in the post RAM and from that day I never
look back right cuz the phone kept ringing as I said before those three ways I've got it I've got people coming in I've got a
phone order the phone never stopped ringing right and I got mail each day yeah and
that first day I got 80 orders from the mail because it was for Friday Saturday and it all came down from right for all
the different places I think and went out on a Wednesday or Thursday yeah it was in the shops on the Friday the
people fought on the Saturday and on the Monday and I that was when a staff I never thought it would be so successful
because nobody have explained but now the magazine's never backed anything up yeah as I said to Ellis tronics there
the board he sold two or three out of out of twenty yeah and there were just a total fire less I knew what not to do
right and that's what you learn and that's the whole idea what not to do so whenever you work for somebody you learn
the way they behave you say that you weren't behaved like that and I learned from my teachers how not to teach yeah
when I was a teacher I went along to the Education Department they said what subject are you taking I said I'm taking
electronics and I've taken physics and I obtained a mathematics at the technical school I see we need to teach you on
Monday down a such-and-such a school turn up and I went into the class and start teaching the very next day no
training no help nothing at all you walk in it was necessarily I didn't learn
what to do yeah what not to do with the other way you teach how to can't teach people how to
tell how to treat people yeah and that's the secret in this life yeah because all those teachers that I
had with a is right our failure I've had so many who couldn't teach anything and
I'm sitting there guy and and I would know the stuff and I'm sitting there going shaking my head just going oh you
know these kids aren't learning anything you know it's just and that's why it's so important for you to have these
videos because each little video teaches one more little thing little tiny that's
your artist and that's the way that's the way you do it one little thing at the time yeah any building up a live
because now it's all identified and that's that's what I did with a line I
tried to put a library in the front of all the different words all the different things we covered and was just
amazing how many topics we'd covered just in those 25 magazine years you know
number of topics were covered yeah and I put a glossary in the back and we just covered so many so many areas and that's
why the end is so wonderful because that's where you can learn you don't have learnt spend anything on textbooks
absolutely nothing you can do every single thing you want for free absolutely not spinning one single cent
you've just got to put the effort in just look on the net just look on Google and everything is there it's wonderful
fantastic symbols put it there for you and there's tons of stuff on your website I'll put up the link it's
talking electronics calm yes X I sure thank my magic I put your link
there and and that's the whole thing and that's what people like yes I like to come to site with its other links yep
because I just go on and on long and just spider their way right through to
all sorts of different things well I'll see you next time thank you very much for sharing your story it's been a been a wonderful brain test

## part2
so during this time whether it will and
when talking to us was quite successful
I thought of going to take you to
America oh really so okay I rang up I
rang up America cause I had to start 2
o'clock in the morning because that was
there anytime and I rang up a big
printing company over there of some an
international type of printing company
to print the magazine and I said
different makers all years before
reprint magazines and I said do you do
distribution oh yes we do distribution
as well so wonderful so I've got a some
magazines already here to take over and
I've got all the articles and everything
ready and I took the computers over put
the computers in in a palace and things
like that I took the hard drives myself
in there were no notebooks back in those
days no no no I've drives everything I
took the hard drives out put them in my
own suitcases I took the suit in my own
personal bag took the hard drives and
went over there and went to the
publishing and went to the printing
place got the 102,000 magazine printed
and I said well they're ready now and
and do the distribution so give me the
Nomi distributor yeah I said you do
distribution
I know give us the name all distributed
for you oh so I had all these magazines
I may have known a fraction before that
so I went to capital distribution
company which was in New York and they
wanted a schedule of when you going to
produce the magazine on that particular
day had to be now have you slotted in on
that particular day why is that
oh because they've dead but they do
should be so many hundreds of magazine
yeah it all had to be all fine line they
wanted samples of the magazine so I
mocked up a couple of samples and of
course then they said okay then we'll
give it to our board to to analyze the
magazine and see if it's successful I
said it's not a pornographic magazine
oh this is going to be all right I know
we have to assess it and and and and you
have to say what's going to be exist
accept it or not so two weeks later I
ran right say no it's not accepted we
don't accept to to is to that the
markets too limited and it's too
it's too technical unbeliev so I then
turned around and I found output in
Australia I was dealing with 1,200 shops
they were up to 1,200 shops and then
they had sub agencies so I had 2,400
shops possibility of news ages in
Australia well America in those days was
about 170 million and we were about 17
million yeah so there was about 16 or 17
times the size I thought well there's 20
thousand shops in America that will sell
my magazine do you know how many news
agents there are in America no 20 what
20 2013 years agents how do you figure
that because that's all there are
really yes all the rest of them are
chains of bookstores all magazines there
right or department stores that have
magazine racks I can't say I've ever
looked when I moved to them that's a
huge mistake I made oh no you just as
soon as I write I mean thought so she
thought I might know an American
audience are probably wondering what
we're talking about right they don't
have them so even even to this day even
to this time they've got they've got
different like 120 stores of book stores
like like Barnes & Noble because in
almost a million 20 stores then they've
got and another one they've got 120
stores and you got to go to the CEO that
store to distribute through there it's
enormous it complex they do have
distributors that distribute in America
but the end is driven in four or six
states and is but then there's another
one delivers in the central then there's
one that lives in the in the west coast
or the east coast so you've got to go
through at least five different
distributors there's no uniform
Universal distributor so that was
normally complex and also to hard you'll
get far too hot so what do you do with
the hotels well what I did was is that I
turned around and I bought a CD that had
either other 10 million 100 million
businesses or I can't me I remember
those CDs in the day
it had I think Merliah ten ten million
businesses and they had twenty to thirty
different categories and you could do
magazines you could do dolls you could
do trains you the whole different
categories so there's one there for
electronics magazine all right right so
I thought well that's great so I picked
out about how to computer sort on it so
I just put in the computer sorted out
that I bought some stickers and I put
them in the machine to know to to print
on them and I printed all these stickers
for all these different shops and I just
put six magazines in it on sale or
return with if they want to sell them
they can sell them or if they don't want
to don't worry
so I started sending out these magazines
in Packers of six I heat shrunk them
myself I bought a heat shrinking machine
and I put a got a hot wire I sealed
around there and I just brought some hot
hot air guns that I hate but the heat
soon stuff and heat shrunk them and sent
them out with with stickers and things
like that three or four days later I've
got pretty nasty calls all coming
through really um we're a mom-and-pop
store we don't Silver's magazine yes I
said but you've ticked the box and all
we just ticked the whole 20 bars all
right
so most of the shops do you know that
there's hundreds and hundreds of church
shops in America really just selling
Church stuff all that that wouldn't
surprise me it's America that's right
yeah so and all these magazines these
Packers on magazine budget cost me two
or three dollars a pack I send out
hundreds and for thousands of them five
in a packet over fifty percent were
church shops that don't sell anything
Church things then there's the
mom-and-pop stores we just have dolls in
glass cages then there's the mother pop
stores and sell all the the Indian stuff
or all the Mexican stuff totally around
ya or knickknacks or all sorts of
nothing to do with with electronics or
macrame or sewing or needlework or
pointe work or everything so that there
was none yes
magazines there was five electronic
shops right only did they sell the
electronics magazines easy in the books
at night was all subscription a whole by
subscription Oh goddess that's right
so what they do is that a magazine it
costs 1995 for a subscription and two
dollars fifty over the magazine two
dollars fifty times twelve comes about
twenty four twenty five dollars I don't
bother charging you for um postage and
things like that so the competition was
pop Tronics yes
soap optronics had a subscription page
19.95 for twelve issues now 1995 and
went through a subscription agency which
they got six dollars soap Optronics only
got 12 dollars yep for twelve issues it
costs them fifty cents to post it Wow
that leaves them 50 cents to print it
they made nothing out of it and you have
to sizing and all tighten yeah so right
that's why the hell under there the
tight was very expensive to advertise so
nobody else could come in yep because
you couldn't make any money yeah unless
you got the advertising that's right
yeah which there are people there but
I've already committed yeah within it
with everything pop tonics on the
12-month the basis there now spending
enormous American TV I'll empathizing so
I just picked up everything you came
home
how long did that suit us six months six
months Wow
yes I'm bought it and when was that what
oh I can't just can't remember now what
issues that issue thirteen or fourteen
thirteen cuz she stopped what what is
she did you end up of issue fifteen
issue fifty that's right because I went
to America yeah and of course that cost
me a lot of money yeah lot of it by Tom
are printing hundred twenty thousand
twenty seven cents a copy here um
getting over there
renting accommodation six months putting
putting the phones on and buying a
printers over there buying I've bought
heared printers to do to do all of your
printing to get all the Flyers and all
the leaflets that went in
to it so I got a big room just like this
big room and put the crappy old
photocopier in the room turned it on and
Julia Joe and he captain stopped he'll
start up again every time it went
through the hot rollers yeah
it stopped because it took about two
thousand watts at a hundred ten volts oh
it was your supply yes right and it
dropped down to about 80 volts 80 90
Elsa said if I had 1920 volts so he
capped and it wouldn't go ahead
what was that the water into the
premises was it wasn't the wiring on it
was the wiring around the wall yeah so I
went back to where it came in and I
plugged it in over here where it came in
and it worked the voltage drop going
around the room it was so much a 2,000
watts that it just hiccup well cuz there
are only 110 volts out there yep twice
everything over there was like going
back 20 years things were just going
down and down and down so then I rang up
the the editor of optronics and I said
that what about putting pop tracks on
the web so I put pop Tronics on the web
started all all the all the projects and
things like that put it all on the web
and he turned around and I would look
I'll give you 25% of the subscription
and I've got quite a few subscriptions
and I sent an article off to pop tronics
to promote the website so I set the
article off wait for the first month
ways the CD articles are going to go on
the magazine on the website you know
those special articles for the magazines
which promoted the website like I said
it was his website wasn't mine he was
getting 75% of the website well not as
though that I was making a huge amount
out of it he was going to make a huge
amount out of it
so the first month second month third
month he didn't even put the articles in
the magazine and in the fourth month
came and I heard that pop Tronics
just just died just follows right then
and there on spot no yes
so the new magazine so that the website
didn't do too well yeah so that I said
well okay I'll transfer it over to
talking a twice website
and just bloomed from then on life once
I got into Google we took a while
yep yes and now course it's just it just
the traffic's Oh astronomical there so I
did with a huge success from their line
right so but that's what happened with
pop Transit has died Lebanon and of
course I had huge huge ideas for
optronics alright I was going to put a
pic chip yep a little tiny project with
a surface mount pic chip on it or even a
hope a thrill whole picture because I
could get them now do you know that
there are better pictures than what you
can buy of it yes in what way well
there's a pic chip instead of buying the
pic that we buy there's at an o8 version
which has got all the best features in
it yep only available in China oh okay
I finish up getting the the the
datasheet for it and it has got one A to
D in it and a few other things where the
other ones either do have an A to D or
don't have something else this has all
the sort of things the Chinese would
want and it's much cheaper than the pain
the 32 cents they can as a die which is
five to ten to twelve cents as a die
yeah so all these Co be things that you
have your sins right are all the picture
a Chinese version of the picture at
between five and twelve cents a die is
that a genuine thing or is that a ripoff
no
not a genuine it's general mind you
right yes okay but they don't tell you
about it yeah that's the Chinese there
you go oh the Chinese are brilliant
really brilliant were there any plans to
get back into the doing the magazine
after that did you have any no go as I
hid my arty passed away right and I do a
lot to help her so I could know two
things so right that's why I had to my
mother and my aunt I so my plan was
taken up but um the pop tronics I was
going to I had a whole road I've got
them still there I got in different
projects or are using and the eight pin
pic chip I've got an alcohol detector
I've got games using all sorts of
different things so talking about an
alcohol detector so I
I contacted some Chinese people for
buying the actual gas to th answer it
sells a sensor right they wanted 70
cents yeah for order for a thousand to
ten thousand 70 cents I had to buy a
thousand yeah to get the 70 cents so it
was quite a big bulky thing but and you
need to pick cheap and you need LEDs and
things like that so I thought well I'll
look around and see on the internet and
see if I can buy something else so I put
disposable alcohol detector on it all
right
and I came up with a whole unit with an
LCD display with the alcohol detector
and you blow in it and has the chip in
it and at times you out and does
everything like that the whole thing for
what dollar 20 have fully assembled I
know you can't compete how could you
possibly could be yeah you can't know
that's not that straight on the head
right but what I was going to do is is
have all this things to educate people
but now you just can't beat the Chinese
yep so I've still got those ten
different projects there right and maybe
I'll put them on the web as different
projects because of their brilliant
project and of course it teaches you
programming it does and that's what
you're where you start you know you
start with just a you know 20 or 50
lines of code start you off with
assembly code and it teaches you how to
program and if you like it can go ahead
there doesn't frustrate you it's not a
language you're going to learn to start
with it's only 35 instructions and you
learn the language and you can't go
wrong because my concept is that you cut
and paste so basically I'll give you the
whole 50 instructions just put them in a
burn the chip
yeah then if you find a successful then
turn around and change a few
instructions yep but the whole idea is
not to get you're frustrated don't don't
make it complicated
like the whole thing simple so that you
can just and if you like it then you can
go ahead

## part3
we'll start off with was one little
thing we'll start off with the FM bugs
FM bugs I now know about how did they
start all right so so up to up to that
point in time the only FM bug was a
terrible one transistor FM bug with an
aerial coil yea orsa which was on lived
on the PC so it's got got no gain for
the mic either it was just one at one
transit act right one Kansas and Accord
had no cue for the coil because that the
coil was as a flat coil on the PC board
oh I'll slum to the boy right yeah very
bad design just a bad design so who did
that one
it was electronics Australian would have
been full weight or somebody like that
kinda for one of the one of these some
big Smith one ways things I think summer
I like that okay so what I had is that I
just can't remember what I was tinkling
with in the in the work room but I was
tinkling with a couple of transistors
and a coil and a little bit of wiring
and things like that and I had to go
obviously you go wait to the to the FM
radio because you don't want feedback
yes so I turned it on and I went to the
FM radio tuned it in and I could hear it
but in those days we had a tuning meter
yeah on that so that very very it was
only one or two basses very very weak so
I thought I will I've got quite clear I
can hear the boys in the room working
and walking I said just just talk in the
back here quietly and I could hear that
so lovely and clear perfectly clear but
almost no signal strength and raw
absolute the signal strength intended
was almost down to nothing so I went
back to these two transistor thing and I
left a wire off I forgot whether was the
antenna wasn't connected right or
something like that wasn't touching so
huh sold that on went back the signal
strength was huge her I thought that's
great so I picked it all up care for a
bit of card or a bit of later took it
outside took it outside and went down
down three or four houses yep and it was
unbelievable it was it just just worked
magic yes normally think of Neff him ray
microphone just to the radio yeah 10
meters or 5 years adjusted within the
room and I went quite a few houses down
they said here we still picked it up and
it was absolutely amazing
so that was the beginning right I had
just picked up because the other ones
had no cue in the coil so I have no gain
had no output at all that I had just
picked everything right so from that
time on I just made up in circuit board
in that long strip like that because
that's the way the circuit works no one
had no one had done that before
everybody just made a square square one
which was just senseless every part all
odd part everywhere the actual board
didn't match the circuit diagram there's
no correlation there was no it was no no
mechanics with the whole thing so I
changed the whole concept to make it to
make it all logical linear make it work
and put the FM back at the ant was the
first one the end and that's absolutely
brilliant that was in one of your
regular issues wasn't it I don't have me
whether I put it on the cover or
something like that yeah I chose every
one of those things I did the PC board
for it I made a book up 5 FM bugs 5 FM
bugs yeah I've got the whole collection
I've still got the whole selection it
was just huge success yeah and of course
we had variations on the whole thing we
put we put amplifiers on it we had RF
amplifiers we put extra transistors all
different concepts all very low the
whole idea was to keep it under 30 or 50
milli watts because when you start
getting a high output you get splash
over you get annoyance you get people
interfering with things and you do get a
lot of problems so my idea was never to
have this one water Machel RF amplifier
stage was all just how much you can do
with very little yep very little output
one of the people came back to me either
wrote to me or rang me up or something
he had put one of the bugs on mount
dandenong yeah
he lived 27 kilometres away down looked
down the way and he still heard his star
got 27 kilometers and it would have been
no more than it was it was a a grenade
or very simple thing you had the heart
yep and it had no interference in
between and he would have
decent antenna on it two years the
half-wave like yes you put and he's
ready and he's a car ready would have
had a good receiver yeah but it still
went 27 kilometers with I wouldn't be
more than between 10 or 30 Mille watts
so these were your most pop probably
your most popular they were rejecting
the FM buddies day they were the one you
had the train books where a huge okay I
was never into the trial because I was
sort of passed my train period a track
tiredness trying three times more train
people really than electronics people
yep
I can imagine and what were in the try
and just train controllers your
controllers yes yes and sounds and he
had a few sounds and things
yes pedestrian crossing and we had
capacitor discharge unit we had a power
supply cord and a whole range of
different things they've been a huge
success because people with train sets
can't get these add-ons yeah
and they spend thousands on their train
set yeah and they want to have added
features as well make it interactive you
like it yes yes because the trains it's
not just trains going around it's
actually the things like things move in
others
oh it's it's a whole life behind people
I have is running around the kitchen
through the walls okay so how many trade
books did you produce - oh there were
maybe two but the games were very very
very very right oh wow oh we must use
sales for these kids in Australia
because somebody seems only in a second
in Australia right right okay so you
didn't really hear it was low Avenue for
overseas no no in anyway that's right
and then that brings me on to how people
paid for things cuz I remember you were
the only one who only business that I
knew of who would accept our stem
payment is I was a kid I don't have well
we didn't have credit cards back in
those or if you did you know just pay me
no we do and at the fourth or fifth
magazine one of the boys who was
certainly a customer came to me I was in
the room he said yeah a castle has got a
state bank credit card here we take
credit cards I said what's a credit
I said what's the point in there yeah
well but I kept my mouth shut I thought
no I won't make a fool of myself I said
what I'll do is I'll go to the bank and
I'll find out about it yep so went the
nted Bank $70 yeah to buy the machine
there the MGM prehnite at $70 to set to
set it all up yeah and in the finish of
course they didn't have to send us the
car people thought they descenders the
card on something you should post the
card to post as it didn't feel yeah well
I thought the head to just pose a head
right
but eventually they understood that they
could they could write the number down
and they didn't have another secret
number on the back in the old day I just
had the in fact was only 14 digits to
start I was yeah and then finished up
with 16 das in the finish so we had the
14 digits and of course and I just
copied them out on our huge sheets and
in finish 50% of our business finished
up credit card 50% 50% what date was
that an hour I can't move it just
gradually increase increasing increase
until 50% of our business cards cuz I
remember when I was still a kid like my
parent were poor family my parents
didn't have credit cards cash for
everything if we didn't have any money
you know and I didn't have you know who
anything like that and and to go you had
to pay an extra $2.00 50 for a money
order or something like that first
office so send in stamps yes that's a
same 2050 of course I use so many stamps
that the quad number but one of the boys
he sent me stamps had already leaked oh
yes so he so they were useless to me so
I had to lick them I had to put glue on
and it stick I didn't mind I wasn't
gonna complain right because you just
never know in this world it's who this
person is actually so a boy rang me up
he sent it for their three kids 16
dollars of time and things like that i
grad used them up because he had uh I
know we got them from now because his
mother worked as solicitor's office she
was washed them off gazed into him all
the ones and in central to me yeah I
didn't complain ascending his Goods
because that's what I often died inside
ahead to be had glue on the nose that's
right I did use them up I was sticky
tape on I'll use them up
what'd she have an electronic see we
bought Sheridan oh you argue right you
you bought out Sheridan I'm not boil us
to awkward all right I could by man
right okay of course he said he wanted
150,000 for ODT so I went on today and
of course he was cries at aw it's all
been gone for 23,000 you know I said
well you know it's all last year stuff
yeah I took a few thousand dollars with
it but but that's all you can get now of
course I couldn't even get rid of what I
even bought it from I couldn't get rid
of it yeah cuz it was just dying yeah
their feet as we were going he was lucky
to to move out when he did because yeah
he couldn't sell I said you've tried
you're spending $400 every month you
need types Australia yeah putting out
all your specials and sold a few bucket
loads but he still had he had hundreds
of thousands of dollars yeah and he
150,000 just to clear out the statistic
area well I have little space I think I
bought some a whole bunch of stuff I see
tubes a friend of mine bought out a
bunch of his component carriers stuff
like yes you know and then he Sun
started up in Blacktown I did started a
story a message which listen to your
muster taken all the debris either stock
he took a fair bit leave that didn't
last more than six months and I I don't
know what if I haven't poor Mike
Sheridan he'd what there was Dave Reed
electronics in the city as well sure
what happened to them but yeah
were there any other surplus yes they
were component supplies in Melbourne yes
yes well Johnny Ellis at dad's office
yes okay D electronic he standard off he
first of all bought all stuff from
Tottenham he bought all their old crows
and all their tests equip right because
we used to do a lot of them electronic
stuff here yeah for England we made a
few planes here and we made a lot of
equipment to send to England
yes worked very technical here so we
sent off a lot of radios and things like
that from here and then we had a little
equipment and he had all that no obvious
just a round tube in a very old it might
have been five maker something like that
he had you have hundreds and hundreds of
crows and a little tiny shop me made a
lot of money out of the crazy for
collecting nothing he had a huge amount
of money and then he started to store
and he bought a lot of surface stuff
into the store then he bought a lot of
new stuff and of course it just boomed
and boom of course then it's slid away
yeah
as the market went away you know just
every year was it was just dying
## part4
do you think that there's any chance
that anyone would and online electronics
magazine would be successful do you see
any like as a PDF or something like that
can you see sort of that magazine style
taking off again or has the individual
Google and the individual content and
world web pages sort of I've got it I've
got about 100 100 meet on my side yeah
as HTML pages it's also at pinis yes
yeah and you can buy the CD for it a few
people do buy it
most people just download what it is
yeah so that people have realized
everything on the Internet's free now
yeah every book you want is all free
from ebooks or all from from any of
these share share places yeah you can
get every single book that you want
electronics book as well yeah and when
you do get them and you download them
there might be 50 mega something like
that and now it's 40 or 50 dollars and
you download you realise that it wasn't
worth fifty dollars
you know you're lucky you got it for
nothing and it really doesn't really
tell you that much you really do need
about 20 or 30 books because some are a
little bit in and some are got a few
years things some are far too technical
so that people are buying less and less
books they're just downloading them for
free and just realizing that's the way
to get you information there because
everything is free
well I found that some books I just I
just wouldn't get it the information
just wasn't presented in the way that my
mind worked yet another one exactly the
same information but presented in a
slightly different way it just that's
right that's why you need 20 books
because you'll find that one of their
books out of the 20 will present it
correctly but a lot of books don't yet
they copy the same concept far too much
mathematics getting into it far too
complicated for you and the question you
asked isn't there so you go on a forum
and ask a person why is it native I was
that the reason why because he's he
tells you in words and that's the very
thing that I do in my site
but a lot more words into things I cut
out the mathematics because I found that
as soon as you introduced mathematics
half you eaters just turned on yep
because I've worked that out because
even on a page of page 1 page 2 page 3
the first one might get 1400 hits the
next page and it's 700 hits for the
month and it goes down and down down so
even when I've just put simple circuit
diagrams on it they only get to the
first page so it does peter out as it
goes down so don't make a complicated
for people cause it'll be it'll be
15,000 on the first page and only 300
millisecond page because you've lost
them yes so people really don't want
anything technical they want to
understand things in a very simple stage
if there was something complicated or
technical they can get a book or go to
university okay but the Internet is
really for people that are really at the
very simple basic level and they can get
the books at the PDF so then give them
off the internet if they want to learn
something kept you can sit down and go
through the technicalities of things so
that's not my job is to is to go into
the higher technical side of things
because I want to get the masses of
people I want start people off right I'm
just in the area which no one's covered
before yeah absolutely nothing to making
a kid that's all I want them to do and
then they turn I like it I don't like it
yeah they want to go on exactly because
I've proven that with the bugs no they
can make the bugs and nearly 1 percent
was successful yeah so that's what I
want to do get interested in the subject
and now you've started the transistor
course well you've done is recent yes
that's your idea give huge change on on
every way that a transistor can be
connected in all sorts of different
circuits and how many or how many
different ways
Oh counts a strong lead is 50 good but
you're you did a 2-part what no I'm like
a hundred right it was a hundred changes
to circuits oh that's that that sexual
service but I don't after another page
on just the transistor as an amplifier
and just doing it as a common emitter
common base for common collector
amplifier or putting two together and
you get feedback it becomes an
oscillator or if you get a positive
feedback the old negative feedback it
changes from an amplifier to an
oscillator so that you can get all these
different effects just out of one or two
stages and that was a that was what I
concentrated on yeah but I have done the
other one on a hundred or two hundred
circuits yes that's very popular as well
yeah people just love that and once you
put that math in there it just all
that's right yes but because there's so
much on the internet that's absolutely
free that all they're going to do is
Google a particular word they get it for
free why pay for it it can't compete
with free
no it's right so you've got to make you
money in other Avonex for my content is
free every everything all my content
I've ever produced over the last 20 25
users because there's been some
brilliant people with enormous amount of
information and they've given it free on
them on the web as well so you can find
professional people give professional
advice it's only the solicitors that
turn around saying yeah you know I send
us $14 and tell you the answer for
something terribly simple that you you
click on Google find the answer on the
next page anyways we're not that stupid
but with electronics there are enormous
number of people that are highly
competent a certain field and they will
provide the answer either on the forums
or on their web sites so that everything
now is freely dispersed in and
everything is I find that it's similar
to the book thing we spoke about you
might have to get a few replies from
people it's the same information but
they all presented in different ways to
you so yes is one one person will ride
it in a certain way and it just clicks
me and somebody else kind of gave you
the same year you've got the full rooms
do you see one personal answer I still
don't understand it yeah another person
oh is that what I do that's for the so
that's why you'll get some people
answering and you'll get the answer and
there's all no cost
instantaneous and it's right on the ball
there in Teaneck particular
pertinent question
and that's the way to go
## part5
and you've got some goodies to show us
what I did look like the goodness for
just brought one box of items it's a
mixture of different things but yep
people will remember some of the things
from the magazine all right I'm gonna
get in closer yes these festive look
this tech computer you see everything
has to be produced before it goes in the
magazine because it you must work
none of this idea that pop it in the
magazine if it doesn't work we'll bad
luck yeah the thing is that all our
things worked because we produce
prototypes and of course that was the
expensive part is producing all these
prototypes and getting them all to work
and giving them to the to the workers to
take home and they're all just hand done
at the time all the chips have been
taken out now because this is just one
of the things that we we gave to them to
produce their own program and make sure
it worked and this is the very first one
of my is these yes the original yes
that's right this is the first once we
got the printed circuit board made I
screwed it down to a base yeah with a
simple power supply because we had to
very quickly get the programs running so
that was the product was the computer
that I devised the first programs on and
would you believe this is the
non-volatile Ram that I put the programs
in and about five years later I plugged
it in and the batteries still were still
going and it had a two seven one six or
273 two in there I can't remember which
one but it took a fraction of a micro M
to keep it keep it from from losing its
memory and it still worked
from 1988 and we change them in 1988 and
that was actually corroded up now but
that still worked after sitting around
for almost year antastic
and this is Jessica this is another
board that we used for the train system
this is a
kated board for the train system uses
zhe for that as well
yep and and then finally we used a
three-chip computer this is the very
secret micro cop that the first one yeah
no I'm not work it was only one board
made of it right at work first go so
that so the actual prototype worked and
when we got the final program working it
was the very simplest I devised the very
simplest three chip computer because we
just want to show what was needed and
what wasn't needed it didn't have a
keyboard but it did provide quite a
number of programs already built into
the in prom and we had all sorts of
different effects that you could get on
the displays but we wanted to show what
the absolute minimum was to get a micro
controller micro processor working in
those days because now we've got micro
control exactly what I spence with that
that you all love to notice somebody on
my forum just the other day asked about
the micro cop one they asked if they
could get the schematic cool and get the
DS yes you can distill in one of the
books yeah it's pretty useful oh that
was a huge advancement in those days did
you get something as simple as that now
look we're just got a box of almost
prototypes just recent prototypes this
is a logic probe which which it has this
is that was it does about nineteen
different features it has inductance
capacitance it has a timer on it it has
a counter on it it has obviously high
and low logic on it and it measures
voltage measured not to 5 volts and not
to 20 volts all with a single chip and a
display and very few components oh it's
actually right let's just leave now
yeah it hasn't got a dedicated board no
no no this is something you can build
yourself because it has so many lines
going to it that it would probably be at
least a 2 or 3 layer board so it was
much easier just to put the wires in
yourself and
and just create the thing but the
beautiful part of surface-mount is that
they're so tiny they almost disappear
yeah so that so the whole thing doesn't
look terribly complicated you know that
you know parts on top and there's there
are a few parts there but they've all
disappeared in amongst the the land so
that's why I like surface mount because
I just use a a magnifying glass to put
them in and if I can do it there are
some very very tiny changes anyone can
do yes that are there are some
transistors in there yeah and the rest
of just surface mount resistors and
capacitors and the electrolytic here and
a Zener diode there and that's all you
need is you put it together yourself but
that that's a Logic Pro this is another
prototype arrangement here this is a
programmer a pic programmer that goes
from USB socket and this is an original
prototype and that you have to program
the chip to stop unfortunately you need
another program to program that or you
can buy the kit is only $25 for the kit
and it's a USB kit again it's all on
prototype board to start with we have
got the final vinyl version there on PC
board but everything has to be built on
prototype board to make sure it works
what we picked up here that looks like
an FM bugged me no this one here no no
this is our challenge Electro's on it
yes sound finiti bug oh the C infinity
yeah and what happens is you put that on
the phone yeah I put it across the two
wires so it's in parallel with the phone
and when you ring the phone this starts
timing and if you ring the phone then
hang up and exactly start to ring again
so that it rings the phone exactly one
minute later within about a 10 second
gap this is opening up itself to within
that gap to receiving the ring pulses
again and if it receives the ring pulses
within the 10 seconds after the
one-minute then it turns on and that it
microphone turns on and anything in the
room you
the ticking of a clock it's extremely
sensitive it uses the phone line voltage
to go down the phone and you can hear
what's happening in the in the room this
just happens to be three high bright
LEDs working from a chip and you can
program it to produce anything you like
has a routine inside it but you can
program it to produce flashing across
there flashing backwards all flashing on
just depends on how you push the buttons
and of course the the steps get
remembered in the chip and just turned
on again and whatever program you put
into it it repeats it so that that's a
little loop idea there that you can
that's exactly the same thing again so
that's that's one of our multi chip
programmers that we've got pics of you
for you to unlock would you have a
melody over two hundred two hundred kids
but but they but it's not just the kids
the fact is that every kid finished up
with four or five prototypes so we've
got a thousand prototypes and we've got
another two hundred kits that we haven't
released yeah I've at least two hundred
years
so we believe any plans to have just
dump the data on those or no no those
are very slowly all these things will
just be released slowly straight astray
to the website
yes that's right yes I'm putting them on
the website now just a few kids of time
and they'll all eventually go there
because there's just so much work has
gone into them so that's basically just
at just one box over the whole range of
prototypes which is no special order I
love the original Tech one computer
that's just you know that's where it
started from
it is that is it that will bring back a
lot of memories for a lot of people I'm
sure it was we sold quite a few of those
in fact I think you sold 1200 yep it's
one hundred yes telephone to tech ones
it was a very popular and we got about
20 or 30 people sending back programs so
it was in those days but what happened
was that very soon after that other
different improvements came along and
unfortunately the the
zedd I came in afterwards and then the
something-something cause five or
something - cause eight from from
Philips that's IV cop eight yes I came
in here and there was a whole range of
chips that start to come in and then
came in of course the the
microcontroller which actually killed
all this yeah cause I was thinking all
along why don't they just add feature so
GD at least that the chip will actually
drive something we say never desert ati
locks never did is i log never did that
and they've got left behind
yeah they got killed by pick microchip
introduced the 16c 84 even even the very
first one even the first eight pin ones
that they had they they had AP months
before the the 500 508 picked 12 f5o
eights and things like that was after
the the 84 was it was well yeah the 84
was the first was a tiger 16 see okay
well they've brought that him and then
they've bought in the smaller version
and so cheap and you know - but actually
the Z 80s were very cheap I finished up
buying them they are made in Italy or
made in in Israel and our doll 50 a dog
25 but it needs so much peripheral it
needs so much around and so much board
space and then you could buy that the
other pig thing to do everything for the
$3.00 so you didn't need the board space
and it was just so much easier to
program of course we just had 700
different instructions you know it was
just a normally complicated thing and
the pics for 700 sections as well it's
just that they're all shrunken down to
36 or 30 yard five that's our 35 days
email instruction AJ but it's still got
the 700 possibilities because you still
set a bit and and and and reset a bitter
so the you do all these things anyway so
he exactly the same features and was it
was really a vast improvement it was
just no turning back once I went to a
pic you know ed Justin gave and
knowledge is the engineers and other
technicians you know but he went back
exactly and it's only the people of the
new about the z8 and the Zed 18 things
that are kept on with it but everybody
else went straight on the Chinese went
straight on to it yep
everything became a microcontroller
design it is thank you very much for the
memories there :

## The Victorian police
"Conversations with Colin Mitchell of “Talking Electronics” magazine fame. This interview took place on the 23rd of Feb 2011 in Melbourne. In the interview, Colin talks about his beginnings with electronics, how he got the idea for the magazine and the books that followed. Colin reveals how he was the first to put a printed circuit board on the front of the magazine and in a famous case, on the front of his series of books entitled “FM Bugs”. The Victorian police bought kits from Colin’s store, including one which could listen in to telephone conversations. This caused a lot of problems for Colin, which landed him a seat in the courts. The Australian WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY ACT 1905 was "repealed" by Act No. 136 of 1983 thanks to Colin's case. Colin off course was shocked and dismayed but continued on selling other kits including the famous TEC-1 computer - A Z80 based project with detailed explanations on how to build and program it."

"I'll leave others to discuss the specifics of the demise of TE. 
From my point of view it stopped because the 1980s ended. Most of the electronics magazines consolidated and then folded by the 1990s. There was a new wave of computer and gaming magazines by then but the electronics magazines which were created to service a market of radio & hifi enthusiasts and TV service repairmen began to fade as a demographic. Electronics Australia, Electronics Today "International", two giants that always dwarfed TE (and resented it greatly) folded. TE's readership tended to split into hardware types and software types and moved into their own circles. "Electronics" was no longer the great binding topic, there were by then too many specialisations. Australian manufacturing (like the British) fizzled out as well as things became more uniform and standardised around IBM's PC (hell even Commodore and Atari vanished).
Then the web happened and also the open source software revolution which cut out the ability to sell information. From my point of view 1980s was a transitionary period from when information was still scarce and hard to obtain. By the mid-1990s, the great information firehose of the internet was everwhere and people are no longer starved of information but drowning in it.
Thankfully however, the internet also saved this stuff from complete obscurity and has given it some renewed exposure. Things that I thought had been lost forever, were scattered or locked away in private collections are now being shared and new things are being built. In the case of the TEC-1, I doubt we would be talking much about it today if it wasn't for the work of Ben Grimmett who got a new TEC-1 board out there and being made. Also thanks to the preservation work of Alan Laughton who collected together so much endangered software from that period. 
And this group of course which has the combination of nostalgic early readers of TE who remember when it was great combined with the next generation of creators and makers who bring a completely new angle to all of this."
