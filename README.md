# Talking-Electronics
the story


Mitchell and I founded a magazine called Talking Electronics with the aim of teaching electronics from the basics. To support our projects, we provided kits, which were an essential part of the magazine. Our business was a mail-order operation from my home, and we sold over 300,000 kits. My interest in electronics began when my aunt gave me her son's old radio equipment when I was 12 or 14. I tinkered with a crystal set, and when I added a little amplifier, I heard my own voice for the first time. From there, I produced lamp-loupe fires and began collecting old hearing aids from Myers, which led to my discovery of transistor-based hearing aids. I built my own amplifiers and began learning electronics on my own, even taking a course on electrical engineering when it became available.
I wanted to learn about transistors, so I went to RMIT to learn the basics of electronics. However, the course only covered the theoretical structure of transistors with no practical application. At the time, the only transistorized device in my household was a six-transistor radio. I later spent 15 years in TV servicing during the early days of electronics, where there was a high demand for servicing despite cheaper radios becoming available. I sold and fixed hundreds of color TVs, including brands such as Philips, Luxor, Finlux, Normandy, Blaupunkt, Siemens, and Gratz. However, these TVs had badly manufactured Philips transistors, which gave a lot of trouble. When Japanese sets with better transistors arrived, I realized my business was disappearing as the sets were becoming more reliable. That's when I decided to start something new and came up with the concept of Talking Electronics.
When I was 20, I wrote a magazine with a simple project using a few gates to control something. I had to describe each component of the circuit and how it worked so that service people could repair it if it failed. However, I didn't understand how a capacitor discharged to create oscillations and a cycle. I read through several books on integrated circuits and circuit design, but they only casually mentioned how circuits worked without providing in-depth explanations. As a result, I had to use my multimeter to describe how the circuit worked, and I realized that there was a void in circuit design knowledge. Servicing electronics required an understanding of the voltages on capacitors and why they failed or malfunctioned, which the books did not provide.
"Of course, they are expensive if you are the person doing it full-time. Well, I didn't know if it was going to be successful, I had no idea. So the only option I had was to write everything myself and get a typewriter. I could type anything out and get it typeset by someone who wasn't a typist. For the first magazine, I just used a typewriter and didn't spend any money on it. I bought a golf ball machine and typed everything out myself. I even did the layout myself, using cow gum to stick everything down. Even the circuit diagrams were drawn by hand with Indian ink. I brought out the first issue, which was a huge success, but I was so busy that I didn't have time to write the second one for about three months. When things slowed down a bit, I finally had time to write the next issue. It was an enormous amount of work to produce just one magazine. I didn't teach anything other than a very narrow field related to making an LED flash, so it was a very specialized area. This was in 1981, just as computers were starting to come in, but it was still a few years before computers could be used to teach or build anything. The only digital device available was called an orbit from Philips, and it consisted of a few transistors and resistors inside an enamel casing. Then we got the very first digital chips, CD 4011 and 4040."
The Shepherd magazine published an article about FM bugs with a printed circuit board on the front, which became very popular. They sold 30,000 FM bugs, including voice-operated and telephone line bugs. The police even bought some to replace their noisy ones. However, the government was furious and raided Shepherd's place, resulting in court cases and financial loss. The court changed the law to enable the sale of the device, but criminal charges were still present for telephone line interception. Shepherd sent out 2,300 magazines to schools, but only received 19 replies, leading to a significant loss. Shepherd designed all circuits and projects himself, including games and trinket-like things that people wanted to build cheaply. The projects were successful and taught people how to put things together.
