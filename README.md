Colin Mitchell and I embarked on an exciting venture, creating a magazine called "Talking Electronics." Our primary goal was to assist people in learning electronics from the fundamentals, and that's why we produced the magazine and provided accompanying kits. The core essence of our publication was to ensure that every project we presented was accompanied by a corresponding kit. We operated mainly from my home, running a mail-order business, although customers could also visit to purchase kits. The majority of our sales were conducted through phone orders and mail deliveries, resulting in an impressive sale of over 300,000 kits.

My own journey in electronics began when I was around 12 or 14 years old. My aunt's son, who was interested in radio electronics, passed on his collection of old vacuum valves and radio components to me. It was my first hands-on experience with electronic components. While building a crystal set, something remarkable happened. As I tinkered with a crystal earpiece near the front of the circuit, I unexpectedly heard my own voice. It turned out I had unintentionally created a small amplifier. This momentous discovery changed my life, as I realized that I could build something beyond a simple crystal set. With no formal instruction or extensive resources available, I embarked on a self-led learning journey. Armed with basic tools like a multimeter and a simple CRO (Cathode Ray Oscilloscope), I devoted myself to continuous learning. The most valuable lesson was understanding how to troubleshoot and fix electronic devices when they didn't work as intended.

To further explore my newfound passion, I acquired old hearing aids from Myers, a local store with a hearing aid section. These hearing aids contained tiny transistorized components, which fascinated me. Armed with these hearing aids and my amplifiers, I delved deeper into electronics. This newfound knowledge and enthusiasm prompted me to enroll in an electrical and electronics course at RMIT (Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology). Although the course had its limitations, it provided a foundation in the theoretical aspects of electronics. However, practical applications were scarce, and there was a lack of resources linking theory to real-world devices.

During my early days in electronics, I worked extensively in TV servicing for approximately 15 years. While the rise of cheaper radios and better quality TVs from Hong Kong and Japan impacted the repair industry, I still sold hundreds of color TVs. However, as the reliability of these products improved, it became evident that my business was facing an uncertain future. Realizing the need for a new direction, I conceptualized "Talking Electronics." The idea originated from my previous experience writing a magazine project when I was 20 years old. That project involved creating a simple circuit using logic gates, and it sparked the desire to explore and share my knowledge. I wanted to bridge the gap in existing magazines, which didn't delve into the intricate workings of circuits or provide detailed explanations.

Hence, "Talking Electronics" was born, with a focus on digital circuits and an innovative approach. Every issue featured practical projects that readers could build and engage with, leveraging the 74 series of chips and CD series digital chips. The magazine introduced a novel concept—each project was supported by an accompanying kit, a first-of-its-kind approach in the world. Additionally, we incorporated printed circuit boards (PCBs) on the front cover, complete with solder masks and solder lands, ensuring a seamless experience for readers when assembling the projects.

One breakthrough moment came with the development of an FM bug, a small transmitting circuit. This simple device could transmit sound wirelessly, enabling users to eavesdrop on conversations within a limited range. We included a PCB for the FM bug in one of our magazines, and it became a massive success. Thousands of units were sold, and variations and improvements to the design followed suit. However, the popularity of these devices attracted legal repercussions, as they could be misused for interception purposes. This led to raids and court cases, prompting us to discontinue their production.

The magazine continued to thrive with its unique offerings. We delved into programming and introduced the "Tech Computer," a Z80-based computer designed to teach programming and the basics of computing. It included a simple set of displays, a keyboard, and a speaker for audio output. The "Tech Computer" became a gateway for many individuals to enter the field of electronics and programming. We also experimented with color covers but found that it didn't significantly impact sales, leading us to focus on content rather than aesthetics.

The 1970s marked a golden era for electronics, as it was a time when cutting-edge components and integrated circuits became readily available. With the rise of computers, individuals could build their own systems, expanding and enhancing them as needed. We witnessed the evolving market demands and catered to the interests of our readers, providing them with opportunities to create and explore. The success of "Talking Electronics" prompted us to expand our offerings, including educational materials, innovative projects, and valuable resources for enthusiasts and beginners alike.

Overall, "Talking Electronics" played a pivotal role in facilitating my learning and exploration of electronics, empowering me to embrace the world of circuits, chips, and programming, as well as countless other individuals who were inspired by our magazine.

## part1

 Hello, I'm here with Colin Mitchell, renowned for his work in the electronics magazine "Talking Electronics." Colin Mitchell's name is instantly recognizable to everyone in Australia, especially those who have benefited from his magazine. When people ask me how I learned electronics, I always credit Colin Mitchell for playing a significant role in my education. I am grateful for his fantastic publication, "Talking Electronics," which taught me so much about the subject. Today, we have the pleasure of having Colin with us to discuss various topics, including the history of "Talking Electronics."

During our conversation, Colin mentioned an interesting anecdote about the magazine's early days. In 1985, he had a unique approach to save costs and resources. Instead of printing and designing the entire magazine himself, Colin proposed a collaboration with "Electronics Australia," a well-known electronics publication at the time. He suggested including a 24-page pullout section within their magazine, where he could share simple projects without advertisements. This way, people could easily understand and replicate the projects with the help of kits. Although kits were not prevalent back then, Colin's approach was innovative.

Colin visited "Electronics Australia" and inquired about their partnership. They didn't offer kits from "Talking Electronics" specifically, but they did receive printed circuit boards (PCBs) from other sources. These PCBs lacked important details like numbers or names, making it challenging to identify them. Colin quickly realized the importance of providing labeled and well-designed boards. He became the first person to include legends, tinning, and solder mask on PCBs, ensuring that they were user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.

To proceed with the collaboration, Colin wrote a letter to "Electronics Australia," expressing his intention to include a pullout section in their magazine. The response he received from Jim Rowe, a representative of "Electronics Australia," wasn't entirely positive. Jim mentioned the costs involved and added a clause stating that if Colin failed to deliver the 24-page section, there would be a fine of $7,500. This amount was significant at the time, equivalent to the cost of two cars.

Colin was taken aback by the substantial fine and chose not to respond. Several years later, Jim Rowe visited Colin and acknowledged that his letter might not have been received well. Colin admitted that he didn't appreciate Jim's message and chose not to reply due to the embarrassment and shock caused by the hefty fine.

Despite this incident, Colin's magazine thrived and became a tremendous success. It became one of the largest kit suppliers, with hundreds of thousands of kits sold. Competitors took notice and entered the market, but Colin's kits were unique and distinct from others. He focused on simplicity and practicality, catering to a wide range of enthusiasts, regardless of their educational background. Colin emphasized that electronics didn't require exceptional academic prowess but rather a hands-on approach, curiosity, and a willingness to experiment.

During the interview, Colin also touched upon the production and distribution of the magazine. In those days, without the presence of computers, the process was labor-intensive. Colin used an electronic typewriter with a memory to type out the articles and diagrams. Each page was carefully composed and glued together, resulting in a time-consuming task. Despite the challenges, Colin's innovative teaching methods, such as hand-drawn diagrams and the grid concept, resonated with readers. He recognized that not everyone learns the same way and tailored his approach accordingly.

The magazine's readership primarily consisted of young people, as it predates the internet and online resources. Newsagents played a significant role in distributing the magazine, and Colin learned that the reported readership figures provided by publications could be misleading. They often multiplied the number of sold copies by a factor to boost their advertising prospects. Colin, on the other

 hand, always aimed for transparency and reported the actual number of sold copies, which was around 14,000 for most issues.

In conclusion, "Talking Electronics" magazine was a groundbreaking publication that revolutionized the way electronics enthusiasts learned and experimented. Colin Mitchell's dedication to providing accessible and practical content made him a pioneer in the field. His innovative ideas, such as improved PCB designs and simplified instructions, set the magazine apart from others. The magazine's success paved the way for future advancements in electronic publications and encouraged a new generation of electronics enthusiasts to pursue their passion.

Jim Rowe's rejection of the collaboration proposal had significant implications for "Talking Electronics." If they had partnered with "Electronics Australia," the course of events would have been different. However, despite this setback, "Talking Electronics" continued to thrive and gained popularity among electronics enthusiasts.

During its peak, "Talking Electronics" faced challenges from competitors like Electronics Today International (ETI) and Hobby Projects. These magazines attempted to rival Colin Mitchell's publication by offering lower prices and increased circulation. Despite their efforts, "Talking Electronics" remained resilient and maintained a loyal readership.

Colin Mitchell recalled an interesting incident involving a young customer who became a dedicated builder of "Talking Electronics" kits. This boy started purchasing kits in grade six and continued to build them diligently. It was a testament to the impact the magazine had on young enthusiasts, even without the widespread availability of resources and support.

The conversation also touched upon the evolution of technology, particularly in publishing. Colin Mitchell described the transition from labor-intensive methods of magazine production to computer-based desktop publishing. He invested in electronic typewriters with memory and high-resolution laser printers to improve the quality and efficiency of the publication process.

Colin Mitchell shared his experiences dealing with legal challenges and attempts to shut down his business. He faced objections regarding running a shop from his home and potential health and safety concerns. However, he successfully navigated these obstacles by understanding and adhering to the legal definitions and requirements of his mail-order business.

Reflecting on his teaching experiences, Colin emphasized the importance of learning from both positive and negative examples. He observed ineffective teaching methods during his own education and vowed to teach differently. Colin recognized the value of breaking down complex concepts into small, manageable lessons, which is a principle he applied to his magazine and now through online videos.

Throughout the conversation, Colin highlighted the wealth of information available online for free, including the extensive resources on the "Talking Electronics" website. He encouraged individuals to take advantage of the internet's vast knowledge base, emphasizing the value of self-directed learning and curiosity.

In conclusion, Colin Mitchell's journey with "Talking Electronics" was filled with challenges, successes, and a commitment to making electronics accessible to all. Despite the rejection from "Electronics Australia," Colin's magazine flourished and left a lasting impact on electronics enthusiasts around the world.

During that time, Colin had the idea of expanding "Talking Electronics" to the American market. He contacted a large printing company in the US and inquired about their distribution services. He prepared the necessary materials and took them along with him, including hard drives, as there were no notebooks back then. He flew to America, arranged for the printing of 102,000 magazines, and eagerly awaited the distribution process.

However, things didn't go as planned. Colin approached Capital Distribution, a company based in New York, and provided them with a production schedule and samples of the magazine. The distribution company needed to assess the magazine's potential success. Unfortunately, two weeks later, Colin received the disappointing news that the magazine was not accepted. The market was deemed too limited, and the technical nature of the content was considered a challenge.

Realizing the complexities of the American market, Colin discovered that the number of news agents in the country was significantly smaller than he initially thought. While he had been dealing with around 1,200 news agents in Australia, the US had only about 20,000 news agents. The majority of outlets in America were chains of bookstores or department stores with magazine racks, and the distribution process involved multiple distributors covering specific regions. There was no uniform universal distributor, which added to the complexity and challenge of distribution.

Colin also mentioned that even to this day, the American market continues to have a different structure, with bookstores like Barnes & Noble having around 120 stores each. Distribution in the US involves navigating through several different distributors, each serving specific states or regions.

Considering the complexities of the distribution landscape and the challenges involved, Colin realized that expanding "Talking Electronics" to America would be a difficult endeavor, especially given the differences in market size and distribution networks.

After Colin's experience with "Talking Electronics" and the challenges he faced with distribution and the decline of print magazines, he turned his attention to other ventures. He purchased a CD containing a vast database of millions of businesses, categorized by industry. This database allowed him to target specific businesses, such as those in the electronics industry, for his magazine.

To promote the magazine, Colin printed stickers with the magazine's information and included them in packs of six magazines. He personally shrink-wrapped these packs using a heat shrinking machine he had acquired. However, when he started receiving calls from customers, he discovered that many of the shops were not suitable for selling electronics magazines. There were numerous church shops, mom-and-pop stores selling unrelated items, and shops focused on specific niches like dolls or Indian and Mexican products.

Colin realized that the American market was more complex than he had anticipated. Furthermore, he observed that the subscription-based model for magazines, where the cost of postage and printing had to be factored in, was not financially viable. He mentioned the struggles faced by another magazine called Pop Tronics, which failed to generate significant revenue despite high advertising costs and low returns from subscriptions.

As a result, Colin shifted his focus to the internet and took the opportunity to transfer "Talking Electronics" to the web. The website flourished over time, particularly after gaining visibility on search engines like Google. Colin also mentioned his interest in incorporating surface mount PIC chips and developing projects featuring the Chinese version of the PIC chip, which offered more features at a lower cost.

However, Colin's plans to revive the magazine after his mother's passing did not materialize due to other personal commitments. He still retains various projects, including an alcohol detector, that he had intended to feature in the magazine. He explored sourcing parts from China but found that the prices offered by Chinese suppliers made it impossible to compete.

Despite the challenges faced in the magazine industry, Colin expressed a desire to share his projects and programming knowledge with others through the web. He believes in simplicity and encourages beginners to start with assembly code, providing a foundation for learning programming concepts. He still has a collection of ten different projects that he may consider sharing online as educational resources for programming enthusiasts.

## part3


Let's start with the FM bugs. The only FM bug available at that time was a poorly designed one-transistor bug with a flat coil on the PCB, lacking gain for the microphone. It was created by an Australian electronics company, possibly Electronics Australian or someone similar.

One day, while tinkering with a couple of transistors, a coil, and some wiring, I connected the bug to an FM radio. Initially, the signal was very weak, but I could hear sounds from the room clearly when someone spoke near the bug. However, the signal strength was almost nonexistent.

Upon further investigation, I realized that I had left a wire disconnected, possibly the antenna. When I reconnected it, the signal strength dramatically increased. Intrigued, I decided to test the bug outside. To my amazement, it worked flawlessly even at a considerable distance, several houses away. This discovery marked the beginning of my journey with FM bugs.

Unlike the previous bugs with no coil gain, my design incorporated a tuned coil, significantly improving the signal strength. I developed a circuit board in a long strip format, which was a departure from the square-shaped boards used previously. This design made the bug more logical and efficient, aligning the board with the circuit diagram.

I shared my innovative FM bug design in one of the regular issues of a publication. It may have been featured on the cover or in a prominent position. I also compiled a book containing five different FM bug designs, including variations with amplifiers and RF stages. The primary goal was to keep the output power below 30 or 50 milliwatts to avoid interference and unwanted effects.

The success of these FM bugs was phenomenal. They gained immense popularity among enthusiasts. People experimented with the bugs and even added their own modifications, such as mounting them on high locations like Mount Dandenong. One person reported hearing the bug's signal from a distance of 27 kilometers, which was impressive considering the bug's simple design and low power output.

The FM bugs became one of my most sought-after creations, and they overshadowed my earlier endeavors in model trains. While I had a significant following among train enthusiasts, the popularity of the FM bugs far exceeded that, attracting three times more interest from electronics enthusiasts.

I can imagine what was tried during the process of developing the controllers. They had various sounds and features such as pedestrian crossing, a capacitor discharge unit, a power supply cord, and more. These additions were highly sought after by train enthusiasts who were willing to invest significant amounts of money into their train sets. People wanted their trains to be more than just a simple circuit; they desired interactivity and movement. It seems that the controllers and add-ons were a huge success, especially among train set owners who wanted to enhance their experience.

When it came to payment methods, the business was unique in accepting stem payments, even when credit cards were not prevalent. The narrator recalls a customer mentioning the use of a credit card, which piqued their curiosity. They decided to inquire at the bank and eventually acquired the necessary equipment to accept credit card payments. Initially, there was some confusion about how to process the cards, but eventually, they learned to write down the card number. Over time, credit card payments became a significant portion, reaching 50% of their business transactions.

In the past, alternative methods were used for payments, such as money orders and sending cash through the mail. The narrator mentions that they had to pay an extra fee for money orders, and they even received stamps from a customer that had already been licked. They had to add glue to the stamps to make them usable. Despite the inconvenience, the narrator accepted the stamps and used them. It seems they understood the importance of customer relations and didn't want to offend anyone.

The conversation then shifts to the acquisition of Sheridan, a company that apparently didn't fare well in the market. The narrator discusses how they bought a significant amount of Sheridan's inventory but struggled to sell it later. Sheridan's owner, who originally asked for $150,000 for the business, ended up settling for $23,000. However, even at that price, it was challenging to find buyers for the acquired inventory. The narrator mentions another friend who bought a surplus component carrier but also faced difficulties in selling the products.

The conversation briefly touches on other surplus component suppliers in Melbourne, including Johnny Ellis at Dad's office and D Electronics. It seems they, too, experienced fluctuations in their business as the market for surplus items declined.

Overall, the surplus electronics market experienced ups and downs, with businesses thriving at times but also struggling to sell inventory as the market shifted.

Do you think there's a chance for an online electronics magazine to be successful? Can the magazine style take off again, or has individual Google searches and web pages taken over? I currently have around 100 HTML pages on my website, which can also be purchased as a CD. Some people buy it, but most people prefer downloading content for free. Nowadays, everything on the internet seems to be available for free, including books and electronics resources. However, while many books can be downloaded at no cost, their quality and usefulness may vary. 

Often, it takes several books to find the right presentation and information that aligns with one's understanding. People are buying fewer books and instead opting to download them for free. However, forums and online communities can be helpful when seeking specific information that books might not provide. On my website, I strive to present information in a way that is accessible to a broader audience, avoiding excessive mathematics and complexity. I have observed that pages with simple circuit diagrams receive more hits initially but decrease as users progress through the content. This indicates that people prefer straightforward and easily understandable explanations rather than technical details. The internet is primarily used by individuals seeking basic knowledge, while those interested in more technical subjects can turn to books or formal education. My goal is to cater to the masses and provide a starting point for beginners. If they develop an interest, they can pursue further learning through more technical resources. Currently, I focus on covering the areas that have not been explored extensively, aiming to engage and inspire newcomers to the field. For example, my bug-making tutorials have proven successful in generating interest and participation. I recently introduced a transistor course, which explores various ways to connect transistors in different circuits.

Oh, a strong lead is great, but you made a 2-part change, didn't you? I'm like a hundred changes to circuits. That's essentially a sexual service, but I don't just focus on the transistor as an amplifier. I cover its various configurations, such as common emitter, common base, and common collector amplifiers. By combining them and adding feedback, you can create oscillators or switch between positive and negative feedback to change an amplifier into an oscillator. So, you can achieve different effects with just one or two stages, and that's what I concentrated on. However, I've also covered hundreds or even thousands of circuits, which is quite popular. People love it, especially when math is involved. But the internet offers a lot of free information. People can simply search for a specific word on Google and find what they need for free. So, it's challenging to compete with free content. That's why I make money from other avenues. All my content has been free for the past 20-25 years because many brilliant individuals have generously shared their knowledge on the web. You can find professionals offering professional advice, and only solicitors might charge you for simple information you can easily find on Google's next page. We're not that naive. In the field of electronics, there are numerous highly competent individuals specializing in different areas, and they willingly provide answers on forums or their websites. Now, everything is freely accessible, and I find it similar to the book scenario we discussed. You might receive multiple responses with the same information, but presented in different ways. One person's explanation may click with you while another's might leave you confused. That's why you'll find people offering answers without any cost, instantly and accurately addressing your specific questions. That's the way to go.

## part5
I have brought a box of items, which is a mix of different things that people may remember from the magazine. These items were all produced and tested before being featured in the magazine. We ensured that everything worked by creating prototypes, which was an expensive process. The prototypes were handcrafted, and once they were functioning correctly, we provided them to the workers to use at home.

One of the items in the box is the original computer I designed. It was the first one I programmed, and it had a non-volatile RAM to store the programs. Surprisingly, even after five years, the batteries were still functional, maintaining the memory. We also have a circuit board used for the train system and a three-chip computer that was a secret microcontroller prototype.

We've made significant advancements since then. For example, we have a logic probe that performs multiple functions, such as measuring inductance, capacitance, and voltage. It is built with surface-mount components, which are tiny but efficient. Another prototype is a PIC programmer that connects to a USB socket and requires a separate program to function correctly.

We also have a device called the C-Infinity bug, which can be placed on a phone line. It activates when the phone rings again within a minute after hanging up. It can pick up sounds in the room with great sensitivity. Additionally, there's a multi-chip programmer and a programmable LED display that allows you to create various lighting effects.

We have numerous prototypes and kits, with over 200 kits and a thousand prototypes in total. We are slowly releasing them on our website. One of the notable items is the original Tech One computer, which holds sentimental value for many people. It was a popular product, and we sold 1200 units, receiving numerous programs from customers.

However, as time passed, other improvements came along, and microcontrollers took over the market. The introduction of microcontrollers, especially the PIC series, revolutionized the industry. They offered more features, were easier to program, and were cost-effective compared to the Z80 and other alternatives. This led to a decline in demand for older technologies.

Thank you for the memories and for your interest in our prototypes. We will continue releasing them gradually on our website, as there is a significant amount of work involved.

I'll let others delve into the specifics of TE's demise. From my perspective, it came to an end when the 1980s came to a close. During that time, most electronics magazines underwent consolidation and eventually folded in the 1990s. While new computer and gaming magazines emerged, the electronics publications that catered to radio and hi-fi enthusiasts, as well as TV service repairmen, started to decline as their target demographic shifted. Electronics Australia and Electronics Today "International," two dominant magazines that always overshadowed TE (and held a grudge against it), also met their demise. TE's readership began to fragment, with some gravitating toward hardware and others toward software, finding their own separate circles. "Electronics" was no longer the all-encompassing topic it once was due to the increasing number of specializations.

Both Australian and British manufacturing dwindled as things became more uniform and standardized around IBM's PC. Even brands like Commodore and Atari disappeared. Subsequently, the advent of the internet and the open-source software revolution played a significant role. They made it difficult to sell information and disrupted the previous scarcity and difficulty in obtaining knowledge that characterized the transitionary period of the 1980s. By the mid-1990s, the internet had become an abundant source of information, overwhelming people with its sheer volume.

Fortunately, the internet also prevented these subjects from sinking into complete obscurity and provided them with renewed exposure. Things that seemed lost forever or were scattered and locked away in private collections are now being shared, and new creations are being built. In the case of the TEC-1, its relevance today owes much to the efforts of Ben Grimmett, who reintroduced the TEC-1 board and facilitated its production. The preservation work of Alan Laughton, who amassed endangered software from that era, also deserves recognition.

Furthermore, this group, combining nostalgic early readers of TE who remember its glory days with the next generation of creators and makers, brings an entirely new perspective to the table. It is this amalgamation that keeps the conversation alive.

......"I'll leave others to discuss the specifics of the demise of TE. 
From my point of view it stopped because the 1980s ended. Most of the electronics magazines consolidated and then folded by the 1990s. There was a new wave of computer and gaming magazines by then but the electronics magazines which were created to service a market of radio & hifi enthusiasts and TV service repairmen began to fade as a demographic. Electronics Australia, Electronics Today "International", two giants that always dwarfed TE (and resented it greatly) folded. TE's readership tended to split into hardware types and software types and moved into their own circles. "Electronics" was no longer the great binding topic, there were by then too many specialisations. Australian manufacturing (like the British) fizzled out as well as things became more uniform and standardised around IBM's PC (hell even Commodore and Atari vanished).
Then the web happened and also the open source software revolution which cut out the ability to sell information. From my point of view 1980s was a transitionary period from when information was still scarce and hard to obtain. By the mid-1990s, the great information firehose of the internet was everwhere and people are no longer starved of information but drowning in it.
Thankfully however, the internet also saved this stuff from complete obscurity and has given it some renewed exposure. Things that I thought had been lost forever, were scattered or locked away in private collections are now being shared and new things are being built. In the case of the TEC-1, I doubt we would be talking much about it today if it wasn't for the work of Ben Grimmett who got a new TEC-1 board out there and being made. Also thanks to the preservation work of Alan Laughton who collected together so much endangered software from that period. 
And this group of course which has the combination of nostalgic early readers of TE who remember when it was great combined with the next generation of creators and makers who bring a completely new angle to all of this."
